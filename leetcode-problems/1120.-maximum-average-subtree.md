# 1120. Maximum Average Subtree

> Given the `root` of a binary tree, find the maximum average value of any subtree of that tree.
>
> \(A subtree of a tree is any node of that tree plus all its descendants. The average value of a tree is the sum of its values, divided by the number of nodes.\)

> **Example 1:**

>
> ```text
> Input: [5,6,1]
> Output: 6.00000
> Explanation: 
> For the node with value = 5 we have an average of (5 + 6 + 1) / 3 = 4.
> For the node with value = 6 we have an average of 6 / 1 = 6.
> For the node with value = 1 we have an average of 1 / 1 = 1.
> So the answer is 6 which is the maximum.
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. The number of nodes in the tree is between `1` and `5000`.
> 2. Each node will have a value between `0` and `100000`.
> 3. Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within `10^-5` of the correct answer.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 DFS

```python
class Solution:
    res = 0
    def maximumAverageSubtree(self, root: TreeNode) -> float:
        def dfs(root):
            left_sum, ln = dfs(root.left) if root.left else (0, 0)
            right_sum, rn = dfs(root.right) if root.right else (0, 0)
            self.res = max(self.res, (left_sum + right_sum + root.val) / (ln + rn + 1))
            return (left_sum + right_sum + root.val, ln + rn + 1)
        dfs(root)
        return self.res
```
