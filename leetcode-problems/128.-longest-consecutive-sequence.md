# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

> Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
>
> Your algorithm should run in O\(_n_\) complexity.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Hashmap

Time: O\(n\)

space: O\(n\)

Loop through array for each number, and update any number key that sits as neighbors of it in hashmap. Update boundaries for all consecutive sequence.

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        bound = {}
        for num in nums:
            if num in bound:
                continue
            l = bound.get(num - 1, 0)
            r = bound.get(num + 1, 0)
            if l and r:
                bound[num] = bound[num - l] = bound[num + r] = l + r + 1
            elif l:
                bound[num] = bound[num - l] = l + 1
            elif r:
                bound[num] = bound[num + r] = r + 1
            else:
                bound[num] = 1
        res = 0
        for k, v in bound.items():
            res = max(res, v)
        return res
```

## Take aways

* Test Cases
  * \[2, 1, 0, 1\] -&gt; has repeated number
