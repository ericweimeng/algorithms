# 361. Bomb Enemy

> Given a 2D grid, each cell is either a wall `'W'`, an enemy `'E'` or empty `'0'` \(the number zero\), return the maximum enemies you can kill using one bomb.  
> The bomb kills all the enemies in the same row and column from the planted point until it hits the wall since the wall is too strong to be destroyed.  
> **Note:** You can only put the bomb at an empty cell.

**Example:**

```text
Input: [["0","E","0","0"],["E","0","W","E"],["0","E","0","0"]]Output: 3 Explanation: For the given grid,0 E 0 0 E 0 W E 0 E 0 0Placing a bomb at (1,1) kills 3 enemies.
```

## Approach \#1

```python
