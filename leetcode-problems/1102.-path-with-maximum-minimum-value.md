# 1102. Path With Maximum Minimum Value

> Given a matrix of integers `A` with R rows and C columns, find the **maximum** score of a path starting at `[0,0]` and ending at `[R-1,C-1]`.
>
> The _score_ of a path is the **minimum** value in that path.  For example, the value of the path 8 →  4 →  5 →  9 is 4.
>
> A _path_ moves some number of times from one visited cell to any neighbouring unvisited cell in one of the 4 cardinal directions \(north, east, west, south\).
>
> **Example 1:**

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 DFS \(LTE\)

Time:O\(\(MN\)^3\)

Space: O\(M + N\)

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumMinimumPath(self, A: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not len(A) or not len(A[0]):
            return 0
        self.res = float('-inf')
        self.dfs(A, 0, 0, float('inf'))
        print(self.res)
        return self.res if self.res != float('-inf') else 0
        
    def dfs(self, A, i, j, max_min):
        
        if i == len(A) - 1 and j == len(A[0]) - 1:
            max_min = min(max_min, A[i][j])
            self.res = max(self.res, max_min)
            return
        
        if i < 0 or i >= len(A) or j < 0 or j >= len(A[0]): return
        
        if A[i][j] == '*': return
        
        max_min = min(max_min, A[i][j])
        print(max_min)
        num = A[i][j]
        
        A[i][j] = '*'
        self.dfs(A, i + 1, j, max_min)
        self.dfs(A, i - 1, j, max_min)
        self.dfs(A, i, j + 1, max_min)
        self.dfs(A, i, j - 1, max_min)
        A[i][j] = num
```

Since score is bounded by the smallest value in the path, the strategy would be always picking the neighboring cell with the largest value for the next step. So we can use a priority queue to take all neighboring cells as candidates for the next step. And each time we pop out the largest one to move forward and update score as well. And I set "seen" cell to -1 to avoid revisiting. Once we detect the destination as one of the neighboring cells, we finish the path and return the score.

### Approach \#2

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumMinimumPath(self, A: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        r = len(A)
        c = len(A[0])
        max_heap = [(-A[0][0], 0, 0)]
        visited = [[0 for _ in range(c)] for _ in range(r)]
        while max_heap:
            val, x, y = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            if x == r - 1 and y == c - 1:
                return -val
            for n_x, n_y in ((x + 1, y), (x - 1, y), (x, y + 1), (x, y - 1)):
                if 0 <= n_x < r and 0 <= n_y < c and not visited[n_x][n_y]:
                    visited[n_x][n_y] = 1
                    heapq.heappush(max_heap, (max(val, -A[n_x][n_y]), n_x, n_y))
        return -1
```
