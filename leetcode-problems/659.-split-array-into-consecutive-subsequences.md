# 659. Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences

> Given an array `nums` sorted in ascending order, return `true` if and only if you can split it into 1 or more subsequences such that each subsequence consists of consecutive integers and has length at least 3.

> Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
> Output: True
> Explanation:
> You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
> 1, 2, 3
> 3, 4, 5

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Greedy

`left`is a hashmap, `left[num]` counts the number of `num` that I haven't placed yet.  
`end`is a hashmap, `end[num]` counts the number of consecutive subsequences that ends at number `num`  
Then I tried to split the nums one by one.  
If I could neither add a number to the end of a existing consecutive subsequence nor find two following number in the left, I returned `False`

```python
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def isPossible(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        left = Counter(nums)
        end = Counter()
        for num in nums:
            if not left[num]:
                continue
            left[num] -= 1
            if end[num - 1] > 0:
                end[num - 1] -= 1
                end[num] += 1
            elif left[num + 1] and left[num + 2]:
                left[num + 1] -= 1
                left[num + 2] -= 1
                end[num + 2] += 1
            else:
                return False
        return True
```
