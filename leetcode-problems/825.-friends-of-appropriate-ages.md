# 825. Friends Of Appropriate Ages

> Some people will make friend requests. The list of their ages is given and `ages[i]` is the age of the ith person. 
>
> Person A will NOT friend request person B \(B != A\) if any of the following conditions are true:
>
> * `age[B] <= 0.5 * age[A] + 7`
> * `age[B] > age[A]`
> * `age[B] > 100 && age[A] < 100`
>
> Otherwise, A will friend request B.
>
> Note that if A requests B, B does not necessarily request A.  Also, people will not friend request themselves.
>
> How many total friend requests are made?
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [16,16]
> Output: 2
> Explanation: 2 people friend request each other.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [16,17,18]
> Output: 2
> Explanation: Friend requests are made 17 -> 16, 18 -> 17.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [20,30,100,110,120]
> Output: 
> Explanation: Friend requests are made 110 -> 100, 120 -> 110, 120 -> 100.
> ```
>
> Notes:
>
> * `1 <= ages.length <= 20000`.
> * `1 <= ages[i] <= 120`.

## Solutions

1. Write a sub function `request(a, b)` to check if age `a` will friend requests age `b`. I just copy it from description: `return !(condition1 || condition2 || condition3)`
2. Count nunmber of all ages to a `map`. Because we have at most 20000 ages but only in range \[1, 120\].
3. For each age `a` and each age `b != a`, if request\(a, b\), we will make count\[a\] \* count\[b\] requests.
4. For each age `a`, if request\(a, a\), we will make `count[a] * (count[a] - 1)` requests.

```python
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def numFriendRequests(self, ages: List[int]) -> int:        
        def request(a, b):
            return not (b <= 0.5 * a + 7 or b > a or b > 100 and a < 100)        
        c = Counter(ages)
        
        return sum(request(a, b) * c[a] * (c[b] - (a == b)) for a in c for b in c)
```
