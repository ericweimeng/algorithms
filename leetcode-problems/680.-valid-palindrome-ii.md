# 680. Valid Palindrome II

> Given a non-empty string `s`, you may delete **at most** one character. Judge whether you can make it a palindrome.

**Example 1:**  


```text
Input: "aba"
Output: True
```

**Example 2:**  


```text
Input: "abca"
Output: True
Explanation: You could delete the character 'c'.
```

**Note:**  


1. The string will only contain lowercase characters a-z. The maximum length of the string is 50000.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1

Before the correct solution, i was trying to solve it just by comparing each pair of char until finds a different pair, code is like:

```python
class Solution:
    def validPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        i, j = 0, len(s) - 1
        found_one = False
        while i < j:
            print((i, j))
            print((s[i], s[j]))
            if s[i] != s[j] and found_one:
                return False
            elif s[i] != s[j]:
                found_one = True
                if s[i + 1] == s[j]:
                    i += 1
                elif s[i] == s[j - 1]:
                    j -= 1
                else:
                    return False
            else:
                i += 1
                j -= 1
        return True
```

This solution fails on test case: "aguokepatgbnvfqmgmlcupuufxoohdfpgjdmysgvhmvffcnqxjjxqncffvmhvgsymdjgpfdhooxfuupuculmgmqfvnbgtapekouga" where on 20 and 80, it is 'cup' vs 'pucu'. This solution naively moves the left point firstly, but ignores the reality that we are not sure which char is the actual char to delete, even thought the current pair is different, move the left pointer first does not guarantee the correctness of the solution. In this case, it fails again on next comparison after moving the left pointer first. But if we can compare the rest of substrings by both moving left and right, then we can guarantee the correctness, while saving the rest of the comparison.

#### Optimal Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def validPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        i, j = 0, len(s) - 1
        while i < j:
            if s[i] != s[j]:
                move_left = s[i + 1: j + 1]
                move_right = s[i: j]
                return move_left == move_left[::-1] or move_right == move_right[::-1]
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        return True
```
