# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

> Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
>
> \(i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`\).
>
> You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return `-1`.
>
> You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
>
> Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of _O_\(log _n_\).
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
> Output: 4
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
> Output: -1
> ```

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Optimal Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if target == nums[mid]:
                return mid
            if nums[l] <= nums[mid]: # when there's only 2 elems, cut in half will always get mid == left
                if nums[l] <= target < nums[mid]: # here and below <= is necessary, because we need to figure out if it's bigger part ordered or smaller part ordered
                    r = mid - 1
                else:
                    l = mid + 1
            else:
                if nums[mid] < target <= nums[r]:
                    l = mid + 1
                else:
                    r = mid - 1
        return -1
```
