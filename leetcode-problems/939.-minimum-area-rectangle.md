# 939. Minimum Area Rectangle

> Given a set of points in the xy-plane, determine the minimum area of a rectangle formed from these points, with sides parallel to the x and y axes.
>
> If there isn't any rectangle, return 0.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[2,2]]
> Output: 4
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[4,1],[4,3]]
> Output: 2
> ```
>
> **Note**:
>
> 1. `1 <= points.length <= 500`
> 2. `0 <= points[i][0] <= 40000`
> 3. `0 <= points[i][1] <= 40000`
> 4. All points are distinct.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1

Time: O\(n^2\)

Space: O\(n\)

```python
class Solution:
    def minAreaRect(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not points:
            return 0
        points_set = set()
        min_area = sys.maxsize
        for x, y in points:
            points_set.add((x, y))
        for x1, y1 in points:
            for x2, y2 in points:
                if x1 > x2 and y1 > y2:
                    if (x1, y2) in points_set and (x2, y1) in points_set:
                        area = (x1 - x2) * (y1 - y2)
                        if area:
                            min_area = min(min_area, area)
        return 0 if min_area == sys.maxsize else min_area
```
