# 674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence

> Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest `continuous` increasing subsequence \(subarray\).
>
> **Example 1:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
> Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
> Output: 1
> Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. 
> ```
>
> **Note:** Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.

### Approach \#1

Time: O\(n\)

Space: O\(1\)

```python
class Solution:
    def findLengthOfLCIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        fails at [1,3,5,4,2,3,4,5]
        """
        if not nums:
            return 0
        res = 1
        i = 0
        j = 1
        start = 0
        while j < len(nums):
            if nums[j] > nums[i]:
                res = max(res, j - start + 1)
            else:
                start = j # originally i = start = j dont move i
            i += 1
            j += 1
        return res
```
