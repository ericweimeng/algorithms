# 1081. Smallest Subsequence of Distinct Characters

> Return the lexicographically smallest subsequence of `s` that contains all the distinct characters of `s` exactly once.
>
> **Note:** This question is the same as 316: [https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicate-letters/](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicate-letters/)
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: s = "bcabc"
> Output: "abc"
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: s = "cbacdcbc"
> Output: "acdb"
> ```
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> * `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
> * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Dic + Stack + Set

Time: O\(n\)

Space: O\(26\)

```python
class Solution:
    def smallestSubsequence(self, s: str) -> str:
        if not s: return ''
        
        last_occr = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(s)}
        cur_res = []
        visited = set()
        
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c not in visited:
                while cur_res and c < cur_res[-1] and last_occr[cur_res[-1]] > i:
                    visited.remove(cur_res.pop())
                visited.add(c)
                cur_res.append(c)
                
        return ''.join(cur_res)
```
