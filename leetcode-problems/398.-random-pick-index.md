# 398. Random Pick Index

> Given an array of integers with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.
>
> **Note:**  
> The array size can be very large. Solution that uses too much extra space will not pass the judge.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,3,3};
> Solution solution = new Solution(nums);
>
> // pick(3) should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
> solution.pick(3);
>
> // pick(1) should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
> solution.pick(1);
> ```

### Solutions

### Approach \#1 optimal solution

```python
class Solution:

    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        self.nums = nums

    def pick(self, target: int) -> int:
        res = -1
        count = 0
        for i, num in enumerate(self.nums):
            if target == num:
                count += 1
                chance = random.randint(1, count)
                if chance == count:
                    res = i
        return res
```
