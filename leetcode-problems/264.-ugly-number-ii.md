# 264. Ugly Number II

> Write a program to find the `n`-th ugly number.
>
> Ugly numbers are **positive numbers** whose prime factors only include `2, 3, 5`. 
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> Input: n = 10
> Output: 12
> Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
> ```
>
> **Note:**  
>
> 1. `1` is typically treated as an ugly number.
> 2. `n` **does not exceed 1690**.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1, Math, Optimal solution

```python
class Solution:
    ugly = sorted(2**a * 3**b * 5**c for a in range(32) for b in range(20) for c in range(14))
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        return self.ugly[n - 1]
```
