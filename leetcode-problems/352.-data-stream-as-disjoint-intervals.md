# 352. Data Stream as Disjoint Intervals

> Given a data stream input of non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, ..., summarize the numbers seen so far as a list of disjoint intervals.
>
> For example, suppose the integers from the data stream are 1, 3, 7, 2, 6, ..., then the summary will be:
>
> ```text
> [1, 1]
> [1, 1], [3, 3]
> [1, 1], [3, 3], [7, 7]
> [1, 3], [7, 7]
> [1, 3], [6, 7]
> ```

> **Follow up:**

> What if there are lots of merges and the number of disjoint intervals are small compared to the data stream's size?

## Solutions

### Approach \#1

Lazy Merge

If it's trying to add a number that has seen before, then no need to add again. We use a set to record visited elements to avoid repeatedly adding. If it's never been seen before, we add an interval starts and ends with that element like \[1,1\] to a **heap**. Therefore the heap keeps a min, increasing sequence. When getting the interval, that's time when we do interval merging.

Time: addNum O\(logn\), getInterval O\(nlogn\)

Space: O\(n\)

```python
import heapq
class SummaryRanges:

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.intervals = []
        self.seen = set()

    def addNum(self, val: int) -> None:
        if val not in self.seen:
            self.seen.add(val)
            heapq.heappush(self.intervals, [val, val])
        

    def getIntervals(self) -> List[List[int]]:
        tmp = []
        
        while self.intervals:
            cur = heapq.heappop(self.intervals)
            if tmp and cur[0] <= tmp[-1][1] + 1:
                tmp[-1][1] = max(tmp[-1][1], cur[1])
            else:
                tmp.append(cur)
                
        self.intervals = tmp
        return self.intervals
```
