## Solutions

### Approach \#1

```python
class Solution:
    def angleClock(self, hour: int, minutes: int) -> float:
        
        # Degree covered by hour hand (hour area + minutes area)
        h = (hour % 12 * 30) + (minutes / 60 * 30)
        
        # Degree covered by minute hand (Each minute = 6 degree)
        m = minutes * 6
        
        # Absolute angle between them
        angle = abs(m - h)
        
        # If the angle is obtuse (>180), convert it to acute (0<=x<=180)
        if angle > 180:
            angle = 360.0 - angle
            
        return angle
```
