# 10. Regular Expression Matching

> Given an input string \(`s`\) and a pattern \(`p`\), implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'`.
>
> ```text
> '.' Matches any single character.
> '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
> ```
>
> The matching should cover the **entire** input string \(not partial\).
>
> **Note:**
>
> * `s` could be empty and contains only lowercase letters `a-z`.
> * `p` could be empty and contains only lowercase letters `a-z`, and characters like `.` or `*`.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> s = "aa"
> p = "a"
> Output: false
> Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> s = "aa"
> p = "a*"
> Output: true
> Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> s = "ab"
> p = ".*"
> Output: true
> Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
> ```
>
> **Example 4:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> s = "aab"
> p = "c*a*b"
> Output: true
> Explanation: c can be repeated 0 times, a can be repeated 1 time. Therefore, it matches "aab".
> ```
>
> **Example 5:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> s = "mississippi"
> p = "mis*is*p*."
> Output: false

## Solutions

The key to this problem is to consider how source\[0...n-1\] match with target\[0...m-1\], and to start with this way, we take look at last chars for source and pattern.

#### **case 1**

If the last char of pattern is a letter, not '.' or '\*', and source\[m - 1\] = pattern\[n - 1\], then, matching depends on if source\[0...m - 2\] matches pattern\[0...n-2\]

#### case 2

If the last char of pattern is '.' then it matches with source\[m - 1\], then, matching depends on if source\[0...m - 2\] matches pattern\[0...n-2\]

#### case 3

If the last char of pattern is '\*', it denotes the char at pattern\[n-2\] can be repeated once or many times, they are integral. In this case we need to consider source\[m-1\], if source\[m-1\] matches pattern\[n-2\], then we need to check also, how many that chars appeared in source. Is that char appeared 0 times or it just the last char of many of that chars in source.

Furthermore, let's say the char at pattern\[n-2\] is c

* if source\[m - 1\] has 0 c, then matching depends on if source\[0..m-1\] match with pattern\[0...n-3\]
* if source\[m - 1\] is c and it is the last c of many char 'c' in front of it, then the matching depends on if source\[0...m-2\] match with pattern\[0...n-1\]
  * If this is the case, then we must have source\[m-1\] == c or '.'

#### Subproblems

Therefore the question can be resolved into subproblems

If we want to know the end result of wether source matches pattern, we need to check if source\[m-1\], source\[n-2\], source\[n-3\]... matches with pattern\[n-1\], pattern\[n-2\], pattern\[n-3\]...

**Transitional Equation**

dp\[i\]\[j\] = dp\[i-1\]\[j-1\], if i &gt; 0, and pattern\[j - 1\] == '.' or source\[i - 1\] == pattern\[j - 1\]

or

dp\[i\]\[j\] = dp\[i\]\[j - 2\] or \(dp\[i - 1\]\[j\] and \(pattern\[j - 2\] == '.' or pattern\[j - 2\] == source\[i - 1\]\)\), if pattern\[j - 1\] == '\*'
