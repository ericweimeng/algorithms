# 1019. Next Greater Node In Linked List

> We are given a linked list with `head` as the first node.  Let's number the nodes in the list: `node_1, node_2, node_3, ...` etc.
>
> Each node may have a _next larger_ **value**: for `node_i`, `next_larger(node_i)` is the `node_j.val` such that `j > i`, `node_j.val > node_i.val`, and `j` is the smallest possible choice.  If such a `j` does not exist, the next larger value is `0`.
>
> Return an array of integers `answer`, where `answer[i] = next_larger(node_{i+1})`.
>
> Note that in the example **inputs** \(not outputs\) below, arrays such as `[2,1,5]` represent the serialization of a linked list with a head node value of 2, second node value of 1, and third node value of 5.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [2,1,5]
> Output: [5,5,0]
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [2,7,4,3,5]
> Output: [7,0,5,5,0]
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [1,7,5,1,9,2,5,1]
> Output: [7,9,9,9,0,5,0,0]
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. `1 <= node.val <= 10^9` for each node in the linked list.
> 2. The given list has length in the range `[0, 10000]`.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Monotonic Stack, Optimal Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def nextLargerNodes(self, head: ListNode) -> List[int]:
        nums = []
        while head:
            nums.append(head.val)
            head = head.next
        stack = []
        res = [0] * len(nums)
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
            while stack and stack[-1] <= nums[i]:
                stack.pop()
            res[i] = stack[-1] if stack else 0
            stack.append(nums[i])
        return res
```
