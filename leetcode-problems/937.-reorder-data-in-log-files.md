# 937. Reorder Data in Log Files

{% page-ref page="937.-reorder-data-in-log-files.md" %}

> You have an array of `logs`.  Each log is a space delimited string of words.
>
> For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric _identifier_.  Then, either:
>
> * Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
> * Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.
>
> We will call these two varieties of logs _letter-logs_ and _digit-logs_.  It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.
>
> Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.  The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties.  The digit-logs should be put in their original order.
>
> Return the final order of the logs.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
> Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]
> ```
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> 1. `0 <= logs.length <= 100`
> 2. `3 <= logs[i].length <= 100`
> 3. `logs[i]` is guaranteed to have an identifier, and a word after the identifier.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1

The idea to approach this problem is that we define a function for comparing logs, we split each log into two parts: id and rest of the content, then we order each log by checking if the content is letter log first, then rest of the content, and last if there's a tie, use id to compare. And it will keep original order for numeric log.

Time: O\(nlogn\)

Space: O\(1\)

```python
class Solution:
    def reorderLogFiles(self, logs: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        if not logs or not len(logs[0]):
            return []

        def cmp(log):
            _id, rest = log.lower().split(' ', 1)
            return (0, rest, _id) if rest[0].isalpha() else (1,)

        return sorted(logs, key=cmp)
```

```python
class Solution:
    def reorderLogFiles(self, logs: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        def f(log):
            _id, rest = log.split(" ", 1)
            return (0, rest, _id) if rest[0].isalpha() else (1,)
        return sorted(logs, key=f)
```
