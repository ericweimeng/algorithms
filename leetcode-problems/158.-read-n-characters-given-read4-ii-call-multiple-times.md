# 158. Read N Characters Given Read4 II - Call multiple times

> Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method `read` to read _n_ characters. **Your method `read` may be called multiple times.**
>
> **Method read4:**
>
> The API `read4` reads 4 consecutive characters from the file, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf`.
>
> The return value is the number of actual characters read.
>
> Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.
>
> **Definition of read4:**
>
> ```text
>     Parameter:  char[] buf
>     Returns:    int
>
> Note: buf[] is destination not source, the results from read4 will be copied to buf[]
> ```
>
> Below is a high level example of how `read4` works:
>
> ```text
> File file("abcdefghijk"); // File is "abcdefghijk", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
> char[] buf = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters
> read4(buf); // read4 returns 4. Now buf = "abcd", fp points to 'e'
> read4(buf); // read4 returns 4. Now buf = "efgh", fp points to 'i'
> read4(buf); // read4 returns 3. Now buf = "ijk", fp points to end of file
> ```
>
> **Method read:**
>
> By using the `read4` method, implement the method `read` that reads n characters from the file and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you **cannot** manipulate the file directly.
>
> The return value is the number of actual characters read.
>
> **Definition of read:**
>
> ```text
>     Parameters:	char[] buf, int n
>     Returns:	int
>
> Note: buf[] is destination not source, you will need to write the results to buf[]
> ```
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> File file("abc");
> Solution sol;
> // Assume buf is allocated and guaranteed to have enough space for storing all characters from the file.
> sol.read(buf, 1); // After calling your read method, buf should contain "a". We read a total of 1 character from the file, so return 1.
> sol.read(buf, 2); // Now buf should contain "bc". We read a total of 2 characters from the file, so return 2.
> sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> File file("abc");
> Solution sol;
> sol.read(buf, 4); // After calling your read method, buf should contain "abc". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
> sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. Consider that you **cannot** manipulate the file directly, the file is only accesible for `read4` but **not** for `read`.
> 2. The `read` function may be called **multiple times**.
> 3. Please remember to **RESET** your class variables declared in Solution, as static/class variables are **persisted across multiple test cases**. Please see [here](https://leetcode.com/faq/) for more details.
> 4. You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing _n_ characters.
> 5. It is guaranteed that in a given test case the same buffer `buf` is called by `read`.

            num = read4(buf4)
            # no characters from file
            if num == 0:
                break
            # there are more characters available
            self.buffer.extend(buf4[:num])

            buf[i] = self.buffer.popleft()
            i += 1
            
        return i

            char_read += 1
        # required for n chars but not necessarily has this much
        # while n > 0 and self.buffer:

        #     n -= 1
