# 287. Find the Duplicate Number

> Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n \(inclusive\), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
> Output: 2
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
> Output: 3
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. You **must not** modify the array \(assume the array is read only\).
> 2. You must use only constant, O\(1\) extra space.
> 3. Your runtime complexity should be less than _O_\(_n_2\).
> 4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Binary Search

The difficulty in this problem lies in O\(1\) space, and many solution using O\(n\) space can also be accepted by OJ. The solution is applying bi-search in the range\[1, n\] by counting the elements which fall in sub range\(n/2, n\]. If the number is bigger than capacity of that sub range, it means the duplicated integer falls in the sub-range. Otherwise the duplicated integer falls in the other half sub range.

Time: O\(nlogn\)

Space: O\(1\)

```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        lo = 0
        hi = len(nums) - 1
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2
        while lo < hi:
            count = 0
            for k in nums:
                if mid < k <= hi:
                    count += 1
            if count > hi - mid:
                lo = mid + 1
            else:
                hi = mid
            mid = (lo + hi) // 2
        return mid
```
