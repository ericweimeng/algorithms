# 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

> Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
>
> Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
>
> **Example:** 
>
> ```text
> You may serialize the following tree:
>
>     1
>    / \
>   2   3
>      / \
>     4   5
>
> as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
> ```
>
> **Clarification:** The above format is the same as [how LeetCode serializes a binary tree](https://leetcode.com/faq/#binary-tree). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
>
> **Note:** Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1

Time: O\(n\)

Space: O\(n\)

```python
class Codec:

    def serialize(self, root):
        """Encodes a tree to a single string.
        
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: str
        """
        if not root:
            return '#'
        return str(root.val) + ',' + self.serialize(root.left) + ',' + self.serialize(root.right)
        

    def deserialize(self, data):
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree.
        
        :type data: str
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        nodes_left = collections.deque(data.split(','))
        
        return self.preorder_build(nodes_left)
        
    def preorder_build(self, nodes_left):
        if not nodes_left:
            return None
        node_val = nodes_left.popleft()
        if node_val == '#':
            return None
        node = TreeNode(node_val)
        node.left = self.preorder_build(nodes_left)
        node.right = self.preorder_build(nodes_left)
        return node
```
