Time: O\(n\)

Space: O\(1\)

```python
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        if not head:
            return
        ahead = dummy = ListNode(-1)
        ahead.next = head
        for _ in range(n):
            ahead = ahead.next
        behind = dummy
        while ahead and ahead.next:
            ahead = ahead.next
            behind = behind.next
        behind.next = behind.next.next
        return dummy.next
```
