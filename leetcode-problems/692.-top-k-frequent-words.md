# 692. Top K Frequent Words

> Given a non-empty list of words, return the k most frequent elements.
>
> Your answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. If two words have the same frequency, then the word with the lower alphabetical order comes first.
>
> **Example 1:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: ["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"], k = 2
> Output: ["i", "love"]
> Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
>     Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: ["the", "day", "is", "sunny", "the", "the", "the", "sunny", "is", "is"], k = 4
> Output: ["the", "is", "sunny", "day"]
> Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words,
>     with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
> ```
>
> **Note:**  
>
>
> 1. You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
> 2. Input words contain only lowercase letters.
>
> **Follow up:**

> 1. Try to solve it in O\(n log k\) time and O\(n\) extra space.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 follow up, heap

Time O\(nlogk\)

Space O\(n\)

```python
import heapq

class Node:
    def __init__(self, word, freq):
        self.word = word
        self.freq = freq
    
    def __lt__(self, another):
        if self.freq == another.freq:
            return self.word > another.word
        return self.freq < another.freq
    

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
        counts = collections.Counter(words)
        heap = []
        for word, freq in counts.items():
            node = Node(word, freq)
            if len(heap) == k:
                heapq.heappushpop(heap, node)
            else:
                heapq.heappush(heap, node)
        return [heapq.heappop(heap).word for _ in range(k)][::-1]
```
