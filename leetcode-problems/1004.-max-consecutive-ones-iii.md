# 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III

> Given an array `A` of 0s and 1s, we may change up to `K` values from 0 to 1.
>
> Return the length of the longest \(contiguous\) subarray that contains only 1s. 
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
> Output: 6
> Explanation: 
> [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
> Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
> Output: 10
> Explanation: 
> [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
> Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. `1 <= A.length <= 20000`
> 2. `0 <= K <= A.length`
> 3. `A[i]` is `0` or `1`

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Sliding Window, optimal solution

```python
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, A: List[int], K: int) -> int:
        i = 0
        for j in range(len(A)):
            K -= 1 - A[j]
            if K < 0:
                K += 1 - A[i]
                i += 1
        return j - i + 1
```

For each `A[j]`, try to find the longest subarray.  
If `A[i] ~ A[j]` has zeros &lt;= `K`, we continue to increment `j`.  
If `A[i] ~ A[j]` has zeros &gt; `K`, we increment `i`.
