> The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = `10` unit.

**Example:**

```text
Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
```

## Approach \#1 Stack

```python
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        if not heights:
            return 0
        
        stack = []
        res = 0
        # for triggering the area calculation for last element if the entire heights is monotous increasing
        heights.append(0)
        for i, _ in enumerate(heights):
            while stack and heights[i] <= heights[stack[-1]]:
                top = stack[-1]
                stack.pop()
                res = max(res, heights[top] * ((i - stack[-1] - 1) if stack else i))
                            
            stack.append(i)
        
        return res
```
