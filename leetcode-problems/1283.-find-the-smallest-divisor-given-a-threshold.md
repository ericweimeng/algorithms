# 1283. Find the Smallest Divisor Given a Threshold

> Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `threshold`, we will choose a positive integer divisor and divide all the array by it and sum the result of the division. Find the **smallest** divisor such that the result mentioned above is less than or equal to `threshold`.
>
> Each result of division is rounded to the nearest integer greater than or equal to that element. \(For example: 7/3 = 3 and 10/2 = 5\).
>
> It is guaranteed that there will be an answer.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: nums = [1,2,5,9], threshold = 6
> Output: 5
> Explanation: We can get a sum to 17 (1+2+5+9) if the divisor is 1. 
> If the divisor is 4 we can get a sum to 7 (1+1+2+3) and if the divisor is 5 the sum will be 5 (1+1+1+2). 
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: nums = [2,3,5,7,11], threshold = 11
> Output: 3
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input: nums = [19], threshold = 5
> Output: 4
> ```
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> * `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4`
> * `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
> * `nums.length <= threshold <= 10^6`

## Solutions

### Approach \#1

```python
class Solution:
    def smallestDivisor(self, nums: List[int], threshold: int) -> int:
        l, r = 1, max(nums)
        while l < r:
            m, sums = (l + r) // 2, 0
            for num in nums:
                sums += math.ceil(num / m)
            if sums > threshold:
                l = m + 1
            else:
                r = m
        return l
```
