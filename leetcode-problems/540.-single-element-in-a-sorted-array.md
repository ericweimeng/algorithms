# 540. Single Element in a Sorted Array

> You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once. Find this single element that appears only once.

> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
> Output: 2

>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
> Output: 10
> ```

> **Note:** Your solution should run in O\(log n\) time and O\(1\) space.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Binary Search, Optimal Solution

The index of the single number has to be a odd number, since it can only appear after pairs of numbers

Time: O\(logn\)

Space: O\(1\)

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNonDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while l < r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if mid % 2 == 0:
                if nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1]:
                    l = mid + 2 # watch out, it advances 2, since we have already verified that mid == mid + 1
                else:
                    r = mid
            else:
                if nums[mid] == nums[mid - 1]:
                    l = mid + 1
                else:
                    r = mid
        return nums[l]
```
