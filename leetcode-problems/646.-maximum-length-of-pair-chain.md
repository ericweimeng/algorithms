# 646. Maximum Length of Pair Chain

> You are given `n` pairs of numbers. In every pair, the first number is always smaller than the second number.
>
> Now, we define a pair `(c, d)` can follow another pair `(a, b)` if and only if `b < c`. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.
>
> Given a set of pairs, find the length longest chain which can be formed. You needn't use up all the given pairs. You can select pairs in any order.

**Example 1:**

```python
input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4]]
output: 2
explaination: The longest chain is [1,2] -> [3, 4] 2
```

**Note:**  


1. The number of given pairs will be in the range \[1, 1000\].

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 DP one dimensional array

```python
class Solution:
    def findLongestChain(self, pairs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
        pairs.sort()
        n = len(pairs)
        
        dp = [1 for _ in range(n)]
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i):
                if pairs[j][1] < pairs[i][0] and dp[i] < dp[j] + 1:
                    dp[i] = dp[j] + 1
                    
        return max(dp)
```
