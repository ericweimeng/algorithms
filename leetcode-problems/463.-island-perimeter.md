# 463. Island Perimeter

> You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.
>
> Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically \(not diagonally\). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island \(i.e., one or more connected land cells\).
>
> The island doesn't have "lakes" \(water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island\). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.
>
> **Example:**

> Input:
> [[0,1,0,0],
>  [1,1,1,0],
>  [0,1,0,0],
>  [1,1,0,0]]
>
> Output: 16

## Solutions

### Approach \#1, optimal solution

```python
class Solution:
    def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        island_nums, collapsed, m, n = 0, 0, len(grid), len(grid[0])
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    island_nums += 1
                    # saving some effort
                    if i > 0 and grid[i - 1][j] == 1: collapsed += 1
                    if j > 0 and grid[i][j - 1] == 1: collapsed += 1
        return island_nums * 4 - collapsed * 2
```
