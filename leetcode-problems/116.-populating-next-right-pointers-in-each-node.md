# 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node

> You are given a **perfect binary tree** where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:
>
> ```text
> struct Node {
>   int val;
>   Node *left;
>   Node *right;
>   Node *next;
> }
> ```
>
> Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.
>
> Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.
>
> **Follow up:**
>
> * You may only use constant extra space.
> * Recursive approach is fine, you may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.
>
> **Example 1:**

>
> ```text
> Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
> Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]
> Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
> ```
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> * The number of nodes in the given tree is less than `4096`.
> * `-1000 <= node.val <= 1000`

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 DFS recursion

Time: O\(n\)

Space: O\(n\) / O\(1\)

```python
class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not root:
            return
        
        self.connect_two_nodes(root.left, root.right)
        
        return root
        
    def connect_two_nodes(self, node1, node2):
        if not node1 or not node2:
            return
        
        node1.next = node2
        
        self.connect_two_nodes(node1.left, node1.right)
        self.connect_two_nodes(node2.left, node2.right)
        self.connect_two_nodes(node1.right, node2.left)
```

### Approach \#2 Iterative

```python
class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not root:
            return
        q = collections.deque([root])
        while q:
            l = len(q)
            last = None
            for _ in range(l):
                # last = None
                node = q.popleft()
                node.next = last
                last = node
                if node.right:
                    q.append(node.right)
                if node.left:
                    q.append(node.left)
        return root
```
