# 322. Coin Change

> You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
Output: 3 
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```

**Note**:  
You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

## Solutions

This is a typical complete knapsack problem where we have infinite amount of each item to choose to get to the target. We can do it using rolling array with normal calculation order instead of reversed order since each item is infinite.

The idea is basically that dp\[i\]\[amount\] denotes that with i types of coins if it's able to get to this 'amount' with minimum how many steps. Therefore the transitional equation can be denoted as

dp\[i\]\[amount\] = min\(dp\[i-1\]\[amount\], dp\[i\]\[amount - c\] + 1\)

Notice that it is 'dp\[i\]\[amount - c\] + 1' not 'dp\[i-1\]\[amount - c\] + 1' , because each coin is infinite, you can pick any amount of c you want to get to the amount, then we have amount - c, amount - 2\*c, ..., amount - k\*c

With one dimensional array:

dp\[amount\] = min\(dp\[amount\], dp\[amount - c\] + 1\)

Initialization:

Amount starts with each coin: coin ~ amount + 1

Corner case: c &lt;= amount and dp\[amount - c\] is possible

### Approach \#1 Dynamic Programming

```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        if not coins:
            return -1
        
        # number of coins
        n = len(coins)
        
        ans = [float('inf') for _ in range(amount + 1)]
        
        # initial state
        ans[0] = 0
        
        for i in range(1, amount + 1):
            for coin in coins:
                if i >= coin:
                    ans[i] = min(ans[i], ans[i - coin] + 1)
        
        return -1 if ans[amount] == float('inf') else ans[amount]
```

### Approach \#2 DP with rolling array

```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        
        n = len(coins)
        
        dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 0
        
        for c in coins:
            for amount in range(c, amount + 1):
                if c <= amount and dp[amount - c] is not float('inf'):
                    dp[amount] = min(dp[amount], dp[amount - c] + 1)
                    
        return -1 if dp[amount] == float('inf') else dp[amount]
```
