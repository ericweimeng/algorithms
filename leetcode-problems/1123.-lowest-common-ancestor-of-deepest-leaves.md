# 1123. Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves

> Given a rooted binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.
>
> Recall that:
>
> * The node of a binary tree is a _leaf_ if and only if it has no children
> * The _depth_ of the root of the tree is 0, and if the depth of a node is `d`, the depth of each of its children is `d+1`.
> * The _lowest common ancestor_ of a set `S` of nodes is the node `A` with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root `A`.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: root = [1,2,3]
> Output: [1,2,3]
> Explanation: 
> The deepest leaves are the nodes with values 2 and 3.
> The lowest common ancestor of these leaves is the node with value 1.
> The answer returned is a TreeNode object (not an array) with serialization "[1,2,3]".
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
> Output: [4]
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
> Output: [2,4,5]
> ```
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> * The given tree will have between 1 and 1000 nodes.
> * Each node of the tree will have a distinct value between 1 and 1000.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1, tracking height

```python
class Solution:
    lca = None
    deepest = 0
    def lcaDeepestLeaves(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        def dfs(root):
            if not root:
                return 0, None
            h1, l_lca = dfs(root.left)
            h2, r_lca = dfs(root.right)
            if h1 > h2: return h1 + 1, l_lca
            if h1 < h2: return h2 + 1, r_lca
            return h1 + 1, root
        return dfs(root)[1]
```

### Approach \#2, tracking depth \(height\) of both subtree

```python
class Solution:
    lca = None
    deepest = 0
    def lcaDeepestLeaves(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        def dfs(root, depth):
            self.deepest = max(self.deepest, depth)
            if not root:
                return depth
            left = dfs(root.left, depth + 1)
            right = dfs(root.right, depth + 1)
            if left == right == self.deepest:
                self.lca = root
            return max(left, right)
        dfs(root, 0)
        return self.lca
```
