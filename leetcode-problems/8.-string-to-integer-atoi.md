# 8. String to Integer \(atoi\)

> Implement `atoi` which converts a string to an integer.
>
> The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.
>
> The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.
>
> If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.
>
> If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.
>
> **Note:**
>
> * Only the space character `' '` is considered as whitespace character.
> * Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: \[−231,  231 − 1\]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT\_MAX \(231 − 1\) or INT\_MIN \(−231\) is returned.

> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: "42"
> Output: 42
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: "   -42"
> Output: -42
> Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.
>              Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input: "4193 with words"
> Output: 4193
> Explanation: Conversion stops at digit '3' as the next character is not a numerical digit.
> ```
>
> **Example 4:**
>
> ```text
> Input: "words and 987"
> Output: 0
> Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is 'w', which is not a numerical 
>              digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.
> ```
>
> **Example 5:**
>
> ```text
> Input: "-91283472332"
> Output: -2147483648
> Explanation: The number "-91283472332" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
>              Thefore INT_MIN (−231) is returned.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1

```python
class Solution:
    def myAtoi(self, s: str) -> int:
        ss = list(s.strip()) # here need to use list() otherwise string does not allow del
        if not ss or ss == '+' or ss == '-':
            return 0
        sign = -1 if ss[0] == '-' else 1
        if ss[0] in {'+', '-'}:
            del ss[0]
        res, i = 0, 0
        print(ss)
        while i < len(ss) and ss[i].isdigit():
            res = res * 10 + ord(ss[i]) - ord('0')
            i += 1
        return max(min(sign * res, 2**31 - 1), -2**31)
```
