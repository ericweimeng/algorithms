# 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

> Say you have an array for which the _i_th element is the price of a given stock on day _i_.
>
> Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most _two_ transactions.
>
> **Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time \(i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again\).

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

## Approach \#1 DP

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if not prices:
            return 0
        
        n = len(prices)
        
        dp = [[float('-inf') for _ in range(6)] for i in range(n + 1)]
        dp[0][1] = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            # phase 1, 3, 5 不持股 dp[i][j] = max{ dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - 1] + p{i - 1} - p{i - 2} }
            for j in range(1, 6, 2):
                # print(i, j)
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
                if j > 1 and i >= 2 and dp[i - 1][j - 1] is not float('-inf'):
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - 1] + prices[i - 1] - prices[i - 2])
                    
            # phase 2, 4 持股 dp[i][j] = max{ dp[i - 1][j] + prices{i - 1} - prices{i - 2}, dp[i - 1][j - 1]}
            for j in range(2, 6, 2):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
                if i >= 2 and dp[i - 1][j] is not float('-inf'):
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j] + prices[i - 1] - prices[i - 2])
                    
        
        return max(dp[n][1], max(dp[n][3], dp[n][5])) 
```
