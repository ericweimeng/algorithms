# 310. Minimum Height Trees

> For an undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as the root. The result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height are called minimum height trees \(MHTs\). Given such a graph, write a function to find all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels.
>
> **Format**  
> The graph contains `n` nodes which are labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You will be given the number `n` and a list of undirected `edges` \(each edge is a pair of labels\).
>
> You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in `edges`. Since all edges are undirected, `[0, 1]` is the same as `[1, 0]` and thus will not appear together in `edges`.

> Input: n = 4, edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]

>         0
>         |
>         1
>        / \
>       2   3

> Output: [1]

> **Example 2 :**

> ```text
> Input: n = 6, edges = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 3], [5, 4]]

>      0  1  2
>       \ | /
>         3
>         |
>         4
>         |
>         5

> Output: [3, 4]

> * According to the [definition of tree on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28graph_theory%29): “a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.”
> * The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Topological Sort

```python
class Solution:
    def findMinHeightTrees(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        if n == 1:
            return [0]
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        q = collections.deque()
        indegree = [0] * n
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)
            indegree[u] += 1
            indegree[v] += 1
        
        for i in range(n):
            if indegree[i] == 1:
                q.append(i)
                
        while q:
            path = []
            for _ in range(len(q)):
                node = q.popleft()
                path.append(node)
                for nei in graph[node]:
                    indegree[nei] -= 1
                    if indegree[nei] == 1:
                        q.append(nei)
                        
        return path
```
