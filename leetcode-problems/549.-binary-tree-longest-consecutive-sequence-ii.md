# 549. Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence II

> Given a binary tree, you need to find the length of Longest Consecutive Path in Binary Tree.
>
> Especially, this path can be either increasing or decreasing. For example, \[1,2,3,4\] and \[4,3,2,1\] are both considered valid, but the path \[1,2,4,3\] is not valid. On the other hand, the path can be in the child-Parent-child order, where not necessarily be parent-child order.

> Input:
>         1
>        / \
>       2   3
> Output: 2
> Explanation: The longest consecutive path is [1, 2] or [2, 1].

> Explanation: The longest consecutive path is [1, 2, 3] or [3, 2, 1].

## Solutions

Few things to notice:

* A node could be either in a increasing and descending sequence, therefore need to calculate both at the same time
* For an either increasing or decreasing sequence to pass a parent node, we need to check if there's left-increasing + right-decreasing or left-decreasing + right-increasing sequence
* Better not using global variable
* If it only needs to calculate using child node val, we can reference directly using root.left/right.val

### Approach \#1

Time: O\(n\)

Space: O\(h\)

At any point in the tree, the possibility that a node in a consecutive sequence, is this node is in increasing sequence from left subtree or right subtree, or decreasing sequence from left/right subtree, or left increasing plus right subtree decreasing

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        return self.dfs(root)[2]
        
    def dfs(self, root):        
        if not root:
            return 0, 0, 0
        l_inc, l_dec, l_res = self.dfs(root.left)
        r_inc, r_dec, r_res = self.dfs(root.right)
        inc = dec = 1 # why 1? because if there's no consecutive sequence from children then only counts current node as 1
        if root.left and root.val - root.left.val == 1:
            inc = max(inc, l_inc + 1)
        if root.right and root.val - root.right.val == 1:
            inc = max(inc, r_inc + 1)
        if root.left and root.left.val - root.val == 1:
            dec = max(dec, l_dec + 1)
        if root.right and root.right.val - root.val == 1:
            dec = max(dec, r_dec + 1)
        return inc, dec, max(inc + dec - 1, l_res, r_res) # inc + dec - 1, -1 means inc, dec has been included root both
```

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        return self.find_seq(root)[3]
        
    def find_seq(self, root):
        if not root:
            return 0, 0, float('-inf'), 0
        
        l = self.find_seq(root.left)
        r = self.find_seq(root.right)
        
        inc = dec = 1
        
        if root.val - l[2] == 1:
            inc = max(inc, l[0] + 1)
        if root.val - r[2] == 1:
            inc = max(inc, r[0] + 1)
        if l[2] - root.val == 1:
            dec = max(dec, l[1] + 1)
        if r[2] - root.val == 1:
            dec = max(dec, r[1] + 1)
        cur_max = max(inc, dec, l[3], r[3], inc + dec - 1)
        return inc, dec, root.val, cur_max
```

## Takeaways

* When there's many scenarios that need to consider, try considering not writing each one them, but com up with simpler way to merge some of possibilities
