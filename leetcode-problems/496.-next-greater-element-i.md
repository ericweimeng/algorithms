# 496. Next Greater Element I

> You are given two arrays **\(without duplicates\)** `nums1` and `nums2` where `nums1`â€™s elements are subset of `nums2`. Find all the next greater numbers for `nums1`'s elements in the corresponding places of `nums2`.
>
> The Next Greater Number of a number **x** in `nums1` is the first greater number to its right in `nums2`. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.
>
> **Example 1:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
> Output: [-1,3,-1]
> Explanation:
>     For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
>     For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
>     For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4].
> Output: [3,-1]
> Explanation:
>     For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
>     For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
> ```
>
> **Note:**  
>
>
> 1. All elements in `nums1` and `nums2` are unique.
> 2. The length of both `nums1` and `nums2` would not exceed 1000.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Monotonic Stack

Time: O\(m + n\)

Space: O\(m + n\)

```python
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        m = { n: -1 for n in nums1}
        stack = []
        for i in range(len(nums2) - 1, -1, -1):
            while stack and nums2[i] >= stack[-1]:
                stack.pop()
            if stack:
                m[nums2[i]] = stack[-1]
            stack.append(nums2[i])
        return [m[n] for n in nums1]
```
