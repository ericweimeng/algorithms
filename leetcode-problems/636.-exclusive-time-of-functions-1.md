# 636. Exclusive Time of Functions

> On a **single threaded** CPU, we execute some functions.  Each function has a unique id between `0` and `N-1`.
>
> We store logs in timestamp order that describe when a function is entered or exited.
>
> Each log is a string with this format: `"{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}"`.  For example, `"0:start:3"` means the function with id `0` **started at the beginning** of timestamp `3`.  `"1:end:2"` means the function with id `1` **ended at the end** of timestamp `2`.
>
> A function's _exclusive time_ is the number of units of time spent in this function.  Note that this does **not** include any recursive calls to child functions.
>
> The CPU is **single threaded** which means that only one function is being executed at a given time unit.
>
> Return the exclusive time of each function, sorted by their function id.

> Input:
> n = 2
> logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","1:end:5","0:end:6"]
> Output: [3, 4]
> Explanation:
> Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 units of time and reaches the end of time 1.
> Now function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes 4 units of time and ends at time 5.
> Function 0 is running again at the beginning of time 6, and also ends at the end of time 6, thus executing for 1 unit of time. 
> So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.

> **Note:**
>
> 1. `1 <= n <= 100`
> 2. Two functions won't start or end at the same time.
> 3. Functions will always log when they exit.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Optimal Solution, Stack

Time \(O\)

Space \(O\)

```python
class Solution:
    def exclusiveTime(self, n: int, logs: List[str]) -> List[int]:
        res = [0] * n
        stack = []
        for log in logs:
            # split each log to get status and id
            uid, status, t = log.split(':')
            # convert to int so that we can add
            uid, t = int(uid), int(t)
            if status == 'start':
                # 开始时间t 和 accumulated time for all function calls in this function
                stack.append([t, 0])
            else:
                start, intr = stack.pop()
                res[uid] += t - start + 1 - intr # key 1
                if stack:
                    stack[-1][1] += t - start + 1 # key 2 add this time to wrapping function call since this is part of its excuting time
        return res
```
