# 347. Top K Frequent Elements

> Given a non-empty array of integers, return the **k** most frequent elements.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
> Output: [1,2]
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: nums = [1], k = 1
> Output: [1]
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> * You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
> * Your algorithm's time complexity **must be** better than O\(n log n\), where n is the array's size.
> * It's guaranteed that the answer is unique, in other words the set of the top k frequent elements is unique.
> * You can return the answer in any order.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Heap

Time: O\(n + nlogk\)

Space: O\(n\)

```python
import heapq
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        if not nums:
            return []
        heap = []
        counts = Counter(nums)
        for num, freq in counts.items():
            if len(heap) == k:
                heapq.heappushpop(heap, (freq, num))
            else:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (freq, num))
        return [num for freq, num in heap]
```

### Approach \#2 Bucket Sort, Optimal Solution

Time: O\(n\)

Space: O\(n\)

```python
import collections
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        if not nums:
            return []
        most_freq = 0
        freq = collections.defaultdict(int)
        for num in nums:
            freq[num] += 1
            most_freq = max(most_freq, freq[num])
        bucket = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for num, freq in freq.items():
            bucket[freq].append(num)
        res = []
        for freq in range(most_freq, 0, -1):
            if freq in bucket and bucket[freq]:
                res += bucket[freq]
            # don't forget when it's getting k, returns
            if len(res) == k:
                return res
        return res
```
