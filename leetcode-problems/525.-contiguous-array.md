# 525. Contiguous Array

> Given a binary array, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [0,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
```

**Note:** The length of the given binary array will not exceed 50,000.

## Solutions

Let's have a variable `count` initially equals 0 and traverse through `nums`. Every time we meet a 0, we decrease `count` by 1, and increase `count` by 1 when we meet 1. It's pretty easy to conclude that we have a contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1 when `count` equals 0.

What if we have a sequence `[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]`? the maximum length is 4, the `count` starting from 0, will equal -1, -2, -3, -4, -3, -2, and won't go back to 0 again. But wait, the longest subarray with equal number of 0 and 1 started and ended when `count` equals -2. We can plot the changes of `count` on a graph, as shown below. Point \(0,0\) indicates the initial value of `count` is 0, so we count the sequence starting from index 1. The longest subarray is from index 2 to 6.

From above illustration, we can easily understand that two points with the same y-axis value indicates the sequence between these two points has equal number of 0 and 1.

Another example, sequence `[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]`, as shown below,

![0\_1487543752969\_figure\_2.png](https://leetcode.com/uploads/files/1487543760956-figure_2.png)

There are 3 points have the same y-axis value -2. So subarray from index 2 to 4 has equal number of 0 and 1, and subarray from index 4 to 8 has equal number of 0 and 1. We can add them up to form the longest subarray from index 2 to 8, so the maximum length of the subarray is 8 - 2 = 6.

Yet another example, sequence \[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0\], as shown below. The longest subarray has the y-axis value of 0.

To find the maximum length, we need a dict to store the value of `count` \(as the key\) and its associated index \(as the value\). We only need to save a `count` value and its index at the first time, when the same `count` values appear again, we use the new index subtracting the old index to calculate the length of a subarray. A variable `max_length` is used to to keep track of the current maximum length.

### Approach \#1 Prefix Sum + Hash map

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        m = {0: 0}
        count, max_length = 0, 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            count += nums[i] or -1
            if count not in m:
                m[count] = i + 1
            else:
                max_length = max(max_length, i - m[count] + 1)
                
        return max_length
```
