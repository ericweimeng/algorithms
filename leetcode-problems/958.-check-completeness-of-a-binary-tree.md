# 958. Check Completeness of a Binary Tree

> Given a binary tree, determine if it is a _complete binary tree_.
>
> **Definition of a complete binary tree from** [**Wikipedia**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees)**:**  
> In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
>
> **Example 1:**

>
> ```text
> Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
> Output: true
> Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.

> ```text
> Input: [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
> Output: false
> Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Optimal Solutions

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def isCompleteTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        seen_null = False
        q = collections.deque([root])
        while q:
            node = q.popleft()
            if not node:
                seen_null = True
            else:
                if seen_null:
                    return False
                q.append(node.left)
                q.append(node.right)
        return True
```

### Previously Tried Wrong attempts

```python
class Solution:
    def isCompleteTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if not root:
            return True
        q = collections.deque([root])
        while q:
            node = q.popleft()
            if node.left:
                q.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                q.append(node.right)
            if not node.left and node.right:
                return False
            if not node.right and q:
                return False
        return True
        
or 

class Solution:
    def isCompleteTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if not root:
            return True
        q = collections.deque([root])
        while q:
            node = q.popleft()
            if not node.left and node.right:
                return False
            if node.left:
                q.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                q.append(node.right)
        return True
```

#### Reason

Attempted to determine if a node have empty child, but it's better to go down to the last level and see if it is complete since if it stays at upper level, if a parent node has empty child, it's not easy to see if it's siblings on the right all have null child or not. **Remember,** this is level order traversal, it's easy to find certain characteristics when the iteration goes down to this level.
