# 207. Course Schedule

> There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses-1`.
>
> Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`
>
> Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
> Output: true
> Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
>              To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
> Output: false
> Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
>              To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
>              also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

> **Constraints:**
>
> * The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
> * You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
> * `1 <= numCourses <= 10^5`

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 

Time: O\(V + E\)

Space: O\(V + E\)

```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        prereq = collections.defaultdict(list)
        indegree = {c: 0 for c in range(numCourses)}
        for c1, c2 in prerequisites:
            prereq[c2].append(c1)
            indegree[c1] += 1
        q = collections.deque([c for c, v in indegree.items() if v == 0])
        courses = 0
        while q:
            c = q.popleft()
            courses += 1
            for nei in prereq[c]:
                indegree[nei] -= 1
                if indegree[nei] == 0:
                    q.append(nei)
        return courses == numCourses
```
