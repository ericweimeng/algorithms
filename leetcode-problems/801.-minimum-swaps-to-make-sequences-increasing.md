# 801. Minimum Swaps To Make Sequences Increasing

> We have two integer sequences `A` and `B` of the same non-zero length.
>
> We are allowed to swap elements `A[i]` and `B[i]`.  Note that both elements are in the same index position in their respective sequences.
>
> At the end of some number of swaps, `A` and `B` are both strictly increasing.  \(A sequence is _strictly increasing_ if and only if `A[0] < A[1] < A[2] < ... < A[A.length - 1]`.\)
>
> Given A and B, return the minimum number of swaps to make both sequences strictly increasing.  It is guaranteed that the given input always makes it possible.

```text
Example:
Input: A = [1,3,5,4], B = [1,2,3,7]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Swap A[3] and B[3].  Then the sequences are:
A = [1, 3, 5, 7] and B = [1, 2, 3, 4]
which are both strictly increasing.
```

**Note:**

* `A, B` are arrays with the same length, and that length will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.
* `A[i], B[i]` are integer values in the range `[0, 2000]`.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 DP, Optimal solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minSwap(self, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> int:
        num_min_swaps = 1
        num_min_stay = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(A)):
            if A[i - 1] >= B[i] or B[i - 1] >= A[i]:
                num_min_swaps += 1
            elif A[i - 1] >= A[i] or B[i - 1] >= B[i]:
                tmp = num_min_swaps
                num_min_swaps = num_min_stay + 1
                num_min_stay = tmp
            else:
                minimal = min(num_min_swaps, num_min_stay)
                num_min_swaps = minimal + 1
                num_min_stay = minimal
        
        return min(num_min_swaps, num_min_stay)
```
