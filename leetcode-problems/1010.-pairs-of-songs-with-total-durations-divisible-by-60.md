# 1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60

> In a list of songs, the `i`-th song has a duration of `time[i]` seconds.

> Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by `60`.  Formally, we want the number of indices `i < j` with `(time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0`.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [30,20,150,100,40]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
> (time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
> (time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
> (time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [60,60,60]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. `1 <= time.length <= 60000`
> 2. `1 <= time[i] <= 500`

## Solutions

### **Intuition**

Calculate the `time % 60` then it will be exactly same as two sum problem.

### **Explanation**

`t % 60` gets the remainder **0 ~ 59**.  
We count the occurrence of each remainders in a array/hashmap `c`.  
we want to know that, for each `t`, how many `x` satisfy `(t + x) % 60 = 0`.

One idea is to take `x % 60 = 60 - t % 60`, which is valid for the most cases.  
But if `t % 60 = 0`, `x % 60 = 0` instead of 60.  
`60 - t % 60` will get a number in range **1 ~ 60**.  
`(60 - t % 60) % 60` can get number in range **0 ~ 59**, which is what we want.

Another idea is that `x % 60 = (600 - t) % 60`.  
Not sure which one is more straight forward.  


### Approach \#1 mod, math

```python
class Solution:
    def numPairsDivisibleBy60(self, time: List[int]) -> int:
        mod = [0] * 61
        for t in time:
            mod[-1] += mod[(60 - t % 60) % 60]
            mod[t % 60] += 1
        return mod[-1]
```
