# 451. Sort Characters By Frequency

> Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> "tree"
>
> Output:
> "eert"
>
> Explanation:
> 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
> So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> "cccaaa"
>
> Output:
> "cccaaa"
>
> Explanation:
> Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
> Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> "Aabb"
>
> Output:
> "bbAa"
>
> Explanation:
> "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
> Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
> ```

## Solutions

### Approach \#1, Priority queue

```python
class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:
        counts = collections.Counter(s)
        q = [(-freq, c) for c, freq in counts.items()]
        heapq.heapify(q)
        res = ''
        while q:
            freq, c = heapq.heappop(q)
            for i in range(-freq):
                res += c
        return res
```
