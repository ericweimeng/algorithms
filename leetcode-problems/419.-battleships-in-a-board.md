# 419. Battleships in a Board

> Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with `'X'`s, empty slots are represented with `'.'`s. You may assume the following rules:
>
> * You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.
> * Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape `1xN` \(1 row, N columns\) or `Nx1` \(N rows, 1 column\), where N can be of any size.
> * At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships.
>
> **Example:**  
>
>
> ```text
> X..X
> ...X
> ...X
> ```
>
> In the above board there are 2 battleships.
>
> **Invalid Example:**  
>
>
> ```text
> ...X
> XXXX
> ...X
> ```
>
> This is an invalid board that you will not receive - as battleships will always have a cell separating between them.
>
> **Follow up:**  
> Could you do it in **one-pass**, using only **O\(1\) extra memory** and **without modifying** the value of the board?

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Optimal solution

Key: only counts tail

```python
class Solution:
    def countBattleships(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not board or not board[0]:
            return 0
        res = 0
        r, c = len(board), len(board[0])
        for i in range(r):
            for j in range(c):
                if board[i][j] == 'X' and not (i + 1 < r and board[i + 1][j] == 'X' or j + 1 < c and board[i][j + 1] == 'X'):
                    res += 1
        return res
```
