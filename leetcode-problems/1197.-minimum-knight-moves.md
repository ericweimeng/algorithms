# 1197. Minimum Knight Moves

> In an **infinite** chess board with coordinates from `-infinity` to `+infinity`, you have a **knight** at square `[0, 0]`.
>
> A knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.
>
> ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/knight.png)
>
> Return the minimum number of steps needed to move the knight to the square `[x, y]`.  It is guaranteed the answer exists.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: x = 2, y = 1
> Output: 1
> Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1]
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: x = 5, y = 5
> Output: 4
> Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1] → [4, 2] → [3, 4] → [5, 5]
> ```
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> * `|x| + |y| <= 300`

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 DFS

```python
from collections import deque
class Solution:
    def minKnightMoves(self, x: int, y: int) -> int:
        moves = [(-2,-1), (-2,1), (-1,2), (1,2), (2,1), (2,-1), (1,-2), (-1,-2)]
        q = deque([(0, 0, 0)])
        visited = {(0, 0)}
        while q:
            r, c, step = q.popleft()
            if x == r and y == c:
                return step
            for m1, m2 in moves:
                n_x, n_y = r + m1, c + m2
                if (n_x, n_y) not in visited:
                    visited.add((n_x, n_y))
                    q.append((n_x, n_y, step+1))
```
