# 157. Read N Characters Given Read4

> Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method to read _n_ characters.
>
> **Method read4:**
>
> The API `read4` reads 4 consecutive characters from the file, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf`.
>
> The return value is the number of actual characters read.
>
> Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.
>
> **Definition of read4:**
>
> ```text
>     Parameter:  char[] buf
>     Returns:    int
>
> Note: buf[] is destination not source, the results from read4 will be copied to buf[]
> ```
>
> Below is a high level example of how `read4` works:
>
> ```text
> File file("abcdefghijk"); // File is "abcdefghijk", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
> char[] buf = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters
> read4(buf); // read4 returns 4. Now buf = "abcd", fp points to 'e'
> read4(buf); // read4 returns 4. Now buf = "efgh", fp points to 'i'
> read4(buf); // read4 returns 3. Now buf = "ijk", fp points to end of file
> ```
>
> **Method read:**
>
> By using the `read4` method, implement the method `read` that reads n characters from the file and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you **cannot** manipulate the file directly.
>
> The return value is the number of actual characters read.
>
> **Definition of read:**
>
> ```text
>     Parameters:	char[] buf, int n
>     Returns:	int
>
> Note: buf[] is destination not source, you will need to write the results to buf[]
> ```
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: file = "abc", n = 4
> Output: 3
> Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain "abc". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3. Note that "abc" is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: file = "abcde", n = 5
> Output: 5
> Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain "abcde". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input: file = "abcdABCD1234", n = 12
> Output: 12
> Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain "abcdABCD1234". We read a total of 12 characters from the file, so return 12.
> ```
>
> **Example 4:**
>
> ```text
> Input: file = "leetcode", n = 5
> Output: 5
> Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain "leetc". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. Consider that you **cannot** manipulate the file directly, the file is only accesible for `read4` but **not** for `read`.
> 2. The `read` function will only be called once for each test case.
> 3. You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing _n_ characters.

```python
class Solution:
    def read(self, buf, n):
        """
        :type buf: Destination buffer (List[str])
        :type n: Number of characters to read (int)
        :rtype: The number of actual characters read (int)
        """
        size_read = 0
        # checking if required # of chars has been read
        while n > 0:
            # buf for receiving chars, since we are calling read4 then allocate size 4 every time
            buf4 = [''] * 4
            # read 4 chars at a time
            l = read4(buf4)
            # no chars to read
            if not l:
                return size_read
            # the length of content get from read4 might less than 4
            for i in range(min(l, n)):
                # buf for this read method
                buf[size_read] = buf4[i]
                # update size that read
                size_read += 1
                # reduce size to the size of chars left
                n -= 1
        return size_read
