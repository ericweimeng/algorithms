# 249. Group Shifted Strings

> Given a string, we can "shift" each of its letter to its successive letter, for example: `"abc" -> "bcd"`. We can keep "shifting" which forms the sequence:
>
> ```text
> "abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz"
> ```
>
> Given a list of strings which contains only lowercase alphabets, group all strings that belong to the same shifting sequence.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> Input: ["abc", "bcd", "acef", "xyz", "az", "ba", "a", "z"],
> Output: 
> [
>   ["abc","bcd","xyz"],
>   ["az","ba"],
>   ["acef"],
>   ["a","z"]
> ]
> ```

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 HashMap, Tuple

```python
class Solution:
    def groupStrings(self, strings: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        if not string:
            return []
        d = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for s in strings:
            d[tuple((ord(c) - ord(s[0])) % 26 for c in s)].append(s)
            print(d)
        return d.values()
```
