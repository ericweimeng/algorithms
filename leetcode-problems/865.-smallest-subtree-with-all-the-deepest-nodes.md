# 865. Smallest Subtree with all the Deepest Nodes

> Given a binary tree rooted at `root`, the _depth_ of each node is the shortest distance to the root.
>
> A node is _deepest_ if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the entire tree.
>
> The subtree of a node is that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.
>
> Return the node with the largest depth such that it contains all the deepest nodes in its subtree.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
> Output: [2,7,4]
> Explanation:
>
>
>
> We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.
> The nodes colored in blue are the deepest nodes of the tree.
> The input "[3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 0, 8, null, null, 7, 4]" is a serialization of the given tree.
> The output "[2, 7, 4]" is a serialization of the subtree rooted at the node with value 2.
> Both the input and output have TreeNode type.
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> * The number of nodes in the tree will be between 1 and 500.
> * The values of each node are unique.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 DFS

```python
class Solution:
    def subtreeWithAllDeepest(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        if not root:
            return None
        return self.find_subtree(root)[1]
        
    def find_subtree(self, root):
        if not root:
            return 0, None
        
        l = self.find_subtree(root.left)
        r = self.find_subtree(root.right)
        
        if l[0] > r[0]:
            return l[0] + 1, l[1]
        elif l[0] < r[0]:
            return r[0] + 1, r[1]
        return l[0] + 1, root
```
