# 53. Maximum Subarray

> Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray \(containing at least one number\) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
> Output: 6
> Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
> ```
>
> **Follow up:**

> If you have figured out the O\(_n_\) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 DP, optimal solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        sums, res = nums[0], nums[0]
        for num in nums[1:]:
            sums = num if sums < 0 else sums + num
            res = max(res, sums)
        return res
```
