# 713. Subarray Product Less Than K

> Your are given an array of positive integers `nums`.
>
> Count and print the number of \(contiguous\) subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is less than `k`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [10, 5, 2, 6], k = 100
Output: 8
Explanation: The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are: [10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6].
Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.
```

**Note:**

`0 < nums.length <= 50000`.

`0 < nums[i] < 1000`.

`0 <= k < 10^6`.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Two Pointers

```python
class Solution:
    def numSubarrayProductLessThanK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        
        product, count, left = 1, 0, 0
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            product *= nums[i]
            if product >= k:
                while left <= i and product >= k:
                    product /= nums[left]
                    left += 1
                    
            # product < k, update count
            count += i - left + 1
            
        return count
```
