# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

> Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: "abcabcbb"
> Output: 3 
> Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: "bbbbb"
> Output: 1
> Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input: "pwwkew"
> Output: 3
> Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
>              Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

## Solutions

### Attempts

1. Fails at "abba" should be 2 but gets 3. Cause: advanced b but not all other chars.

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        seen = {}
        l = 0
        res = float('-inf')
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c in seen:
                l = seen[c] + 1
            seen[c] = i
            res = max(res, i - l + 1)
        return 0 if res == float('-inf') else res
```

### Approach \#1

Time: O\(n\)

Space: O\(26\) -&gt; O\(1\)

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        seen = {}
        l = 0
        res = float('-inf')
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c in seen:
            # get the right most boundary that is the first pos doesn't contain
            # any duplicates
            l = max(l, seen[c] + 1) 
            seen[c] = i
            res = max(res, i - l + 1)
        return 0 if res == float('-inf') else res
```

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        seen = {}
        start = res = 0
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c in seen:
                # below will fail on test case 'abba', when it reaches the last a, seen is {a:0, b:2}
                # the seen only shows the last idx for this char, but doesn't show who comes the closest
                # if we directly use below statement, it will be updated to the idx for current char, but may
                # include repeated char that comes after current char
                # start = seen[c] + 1
                start = max(start, seen[c] + 1)
            seen[c] = i
            res = max(res, i - start + 1)
        return res
```
