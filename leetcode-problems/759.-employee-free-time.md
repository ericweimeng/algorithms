# 759. Employee Free Time

> We are given a list `schedule` of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.
>
> Each employee has a list of non-overlapping `Intervals`, and these intervals are in sorted order.
>
> Return the list of finite intervals representing **common, positive-length free time** for all employees, also in sorted order.
>
> \(Even though we are representing `Intervals` in the form `[x, y]`, the objects inside are `Intervals`, not lists or arrays. For example, `schedule[0][0].start = 1`, `schedule[0][0].end = 2`, and `schedule[0][0][0]` is not defined\).  Also, we wouldn't include intervals like \[5, 5\] in our answer, as they have zero length.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
> Output: [[3,4]]
> Explanation: There are a total of three employees, and all common
> free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
> We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]
> Output: [[5,6],[7,9]]
> ```
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> * `1 <= schedule.length , schedule[i].length <= 50`
> * `0 <= schedule[i].start < schedule[i].end <= 10^8`

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Sorting

```python
"""
# Definition for an Interval.
class Interval:
    def __init__(self, start: int = None, end: int = None):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end
"""
class Solution:
    def employeeFreeTime(self, schedule: '[[Interval]]') -> '[Interval]':
        intervals = sorted([i for s in schedule for i in s], key=lambda x: x.start)
        res, prev = [], intervals[0]
        for i in intervals[1:]:
            if i.start <= prev.end and i.end > prev.end:
                prev.end = i.end
            elif i.start > prev.end:
                res.append(Interval(prev.end, i.start))
                prev = i
        return res
```

### Approach \#2 Heap

```python
"""
# Definition for an Interval.
class Interval:
    def __init__(self, start: int = None, end: int = None):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end
"""
class Solution:
    def employeeFreeTime(self, schedule: '[[Interval]]') -> '[Interval]':
        q = [(iv.start, iv.end) for epl in schedule for iv in epl]
        heapq.heapify(q)
        s, e = heapq.heappop(q)
        prev_end = e
        res = []
        while q:
            s, e = heapq.heappop(q)
            if s > prev_end:
                res.append(Interval(prev_end, s))
                prev_end = e
            else:
                prev_end = max(prev_end, e)
        return res
```
