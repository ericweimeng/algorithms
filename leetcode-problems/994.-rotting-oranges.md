# 994. Rotting Oranges

> In a given grid, each cell can have one of three values:
>
> * the value `0` representing an empty cell;
> * the value `1` representing a fresh orange;
> * the value `2` representing a rotten orange.
>
> Every minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent \(4-directionally\) to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
>
> Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange.  If this is impossible, return `-1` instead.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/16/oranges.png)

```text
Input: [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation:  The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation:  Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= grid.length <= 10`
2. `1 <= grid[0].length <= 10`
3. `grid[i][j]` is only `0`, `1`, or `2`.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1

```python
class Solution:
    def orangesRotting(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        row = len(grid)
        col = len(grid[0])
        
        rotting = {(i, j) for i in range(row) for j in range(col) if grid[i][j] == 2}
        fresh = {(i, j) for i in range(row) for j in range(col) if grid[i][j] == 1}
        timer = 0
        while fresh:
            if not rotting:
                return -1
            rotting = {(i + di, j + dj) for i, j in rotting for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)] if (i + di, j + dj) in fresh}
            fresh -= rotting
            timer += 1
        
        return timer
```
