# 115. Distinct Subsequences

> Given a string **S** and a string **T**, count the number of distinct subsequences of **S** which equals **T**.
>
> A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some \(can be none\) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. \(ie, `"ACE"` is a subsequence of `"ABCDE"` while `"AEC"` is not\).

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

rabbbit
^^^^ ^^
rabbbit
^^ ^^^^
rabbbit
^^^ ^^^
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

babgbag
^^ ^
babgbag
^^    ^
babgbag
^    ^^
babgbag
  ^  ^^
babgbag
    ^^^
```

## Solutions

The solution for this question starts with target string, to check whether the last char of target pairs with the last char of source or not.

**Case 1, last chars pairs with each other**

target\[n-1\] == source\[m-1\], then the question turns into calculating target\[0...n-2\] appears how many times in source\[0...m-2\]

**Case 2, last chars don't pair with each other**

target\[n-1\] **!**= source\[m-1\], then the question turns into calculating target\[0...n-1\] appears how many times in source\[0...m-2\]

To abstract this question, in order to count how many distinct ways to get subsequences from source to equal target we need to calculate how many times target\[0...n-1\] appear in source\[0...m-1\], then in order to calculate that, we need to calculate how many times target\[0...n-1\] appear in source\[0...m-2\] and target\[0...n-2\] appear in source\[0...m-2\], this is the subproblem.

**state**

Let's say dp\[i\]\[j\] denotes how many times target\[0...j-1\] appear in source\[0...i-1\]

**Transitional Equation**

dp\[i\]\[j\] = dp\[i - 1\]\[j - 1\]\|target\[i - 1\] == source\[i - 1\] + dp\[i - 1\]\[j\]

**Initial State**

If target is empty, then the number of times a target appears in source is 1

dp\[i\]\[0\] = 1 \(i = 0, 1, 2, ..., m\)

if source is empty, then the number of times a target appears in source is 0

dp\[0\]\[j\] = 0 \(j = 1, 2, ..., n\)

### Approach \#1, DP, Two dimensional array

```python
class Solution:
    def numDistinct(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        m = len(t)
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(m + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            dp[i][0] = 1            
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, m + 1):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]*(s[i - 1] == t[j - 1])
        return dp[n][m]
```

### Approach \#2 DP, One dimensional array

```python
class Solution:
    def numDistinct(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        m = len(t)
        dp = [0 for _ in range(m + 1)]
        dp[0] = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(m, 0, -1):
                dp[j] = dp[j] + dp[j - 1]*(s[i - 1] == t[j - 1])
                
        return dp[m]
```
