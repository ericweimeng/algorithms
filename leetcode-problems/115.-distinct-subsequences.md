# 115. Distinct Subsequences

> Given a string **S** and a string **T**, count the number of distinct subsequences of **S** which equals **T**.
>
> A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some \(can be none\) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. \(ie, `"ACE"` is a subsequence of `"ABCDE"` while `"AEC"` is not\).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

rabbbit
^^^^ ^^
rabbbit
^^ ^^^^
rabbbit
^^^ ^^^
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

babgbag
^^ ^
babgbag
^^    ^
babgbag
^    ^^
babgbag
  ^  ^^
babgbag
    ^^^
```
