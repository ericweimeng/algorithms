# 75. Sort Colors

> Given an array with _n_ objects colored red, white or blue, sort them [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) ****so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
>
> Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
>
> **Note:** You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
> Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
> ```
>
> **Follow up:**
>
> * A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort. First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
> * Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Optimal Solution

Time: O\(n\)

Space: O\(1\)

```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        r, w, b = 0, 0, len(nums) - 1
        # watch out for moving the pointers in different scenarios
        # key here is the increment of w pointer
        while w <= b:
            if nums[w] == 0:
                nums[r], nums[w] = nums[w], nums[r]
                r += 1
                w += 1
            elif nums[w] == 2:
                nums[b], nums[w] = nums[w], nums[b]
                b -= 1
            else:
                w += 1
```
