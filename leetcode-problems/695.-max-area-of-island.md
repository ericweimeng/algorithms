# 695. Max Area of Island

> Given a non-empty 2D array `grid` of 0's and 1's, an **island** is a group of `1`'s \(representing land\) connected 4-directionally \(horizontal or vertical.\) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
>
> Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. \(If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.\)
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
>  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
>  [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
>  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
>  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
>  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
>  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
>  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
> ```
>
> Given the above grid, return `6`. Note the answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
> ```
>
> Given the above grid, return `0`.
>
> **Note:** The length of each dimension in the given `grid` does not exceed 50.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 DFS

```python
class Solution:
    max_area = 0
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
        if not grid:
            return self.max_area
        
        row = len(grid)
        col = len(grid[0])
        
        def find_area(grid, pos):
            
            # Get r and c indexes
            r = pos // col
            c = pos % col
            
            # Note current position as visited
            grid[r][c] = 0
            
            # result
            res = 1
            
            # DFS find all connected positions
            for d in dirs:
                n_r = r + d[0]
                n_c = c + d[1]
                if n_r < row and n_r >= 0 and n_c < col and n_c >= 0 and grid[n_r][n_c] == 1:
                    next_pos = n_r * col + n_c
                    res += find_area(grid, next_pos)
            
            return res
        
        dirs = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
        for i in range(row):
            for j in range(col):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    pos = i * col + j
                    self.max_area = max(self.max_area, find_area(grid, pos))
        
        return self.max_area
```

### Approach \#2 BFS

Time: O\(R \* C\)

Space: O\(R \* C\)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
            return 0
        
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        res = 0
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    grid[i][j] = 0 # has to mark the starting point to be visited
                    res = max(res, self.bfs(i, j, grid))
        return res
                    
                    
    def bfs(self, x, y, grid):
        
        q = collections.deque([(x, y)])
        
        area = 0
        
        while q:
            x, y = q.popleft()
            area += 1
            for nx, ny in ((x + 1, y), (x - 1, y), (x, y + 1), (x, y - 1)):
                if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and grid[nx][ny] == 1:
                    grid[nx][ny] = 0
                    q.append((nx, ny))
                    
        return area
```
