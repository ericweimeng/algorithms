# 695. Max Area of Island

> Given a non-empty 2D array `grid` of 0's and 1's, an **island** is a group of `1`'s \(representing land\) connected 4-directionally \(horizontal or vertical.\) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
>
> Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. \(If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.\)

**Example 1:**

```
[[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
```

Given the above grid, return `6`. Note the answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

**Example 2:**

```
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
```

Given the above grid, return `0`.

**Note:** The length of each dimension in the given `grid` does not exceed 50.
