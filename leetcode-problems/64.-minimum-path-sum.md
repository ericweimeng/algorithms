# 64. Minimum Path Sum

> Given a _m_ x _n_ grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which _minimizes_ the sum of all numbers along its path.
>
> **Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

**Example:**

```text
Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
```

## Approach \#1

```python
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
            return 0
        
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])
        
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if i == 0 and j == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = grid[i][j]
                    continue
                
                minval = float('INF')
                if i > 0:
                    minval = min(minval, dp[i - 1][j] + grid[i][j])
                
                if j > 0:
                    minval = min(minval, dp[i][j - 1] + grid[i][j])
                    
                dp[i][j] = minval
                    
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1]
```
