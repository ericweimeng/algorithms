# 63. Unique Paths II

> A robot is located at the top-left corner of a _m_ x _n_ grid \(marked 'Start' in the diagram below\).
>
> The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid \(marked 'Finish' in the diagram below\).
>
> Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

>
> An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.
>
> **Note:** _m_ and _n_ will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

## Approach \#1 DP

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not obstacleGrid or not obstacleGrid[0]:
            return 0
        
        m = len(obstacleGrid)
        n = len(obstacleGrid[0])
        
        dp = [[0 for i in range(n)] for _ in range(m)] # 有可能到不了m - 1, n - 1的位置所以需要初始化dp数组为0
        # dp[0][0] = 1
        
        
        for i in range(m): # 从 0 开始 因为有可能有[[1]]这种corner case那么最一开始就不行
            for j in range(n):
                # obstacle 每到一个点先判断是不是obstacle
                if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1:
                    dp[i][j] = 0
                    continue
                    
                # 初始点初始化 因为前面已过滤obstacle情况 所以这里放心set为1
                if i == 0 and j == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = 1
                    continue
                
                # 有可能是第一列或第一行此点之前的一个cell有obstacle, 所以先设为0
                dp[i][j] = 0
                
                if i > 0:
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j]
                if j > 0:
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i][j - 1]
        
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1]
```
