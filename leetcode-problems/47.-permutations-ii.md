# 47. Permutations II

> Given a collection of numbers that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations.

**Example:**

```text
Input: [1,1,2]
Output:
[
  [1,1,2],
  [1,2,1],
  [2,1,1]
]
```

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Backtracking

consider the case where there are duplicates in `nums`.  
The idea is still the same. except we only put the duplicated element in the front once.

For example, 11223  
let 1 be the first element, recursively permute 1223  
let 2 be the first element, recursively permute 1123  
let 3 be the first element, recursively permute 1122

How to adapt the previous code to take care of duplicates?  
We can simply pick out the unique element, and recursively permute the remanning.

```python
class Solution:
    def permuteUnique(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        res = []
        def dfs(nums, l):
            if l == len(nums) - 1:
                res.append(list(nums))
                return 
            for i in set(nums[l:]):
                remaining = nums[l:]
                remaining.remove(i)
                dfs(nums[:l] + [i] + remaining, l+1)
        dfs(nums, 0)
        return res
```
