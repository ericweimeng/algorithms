# 1055. Shortest Way to Form String

> From any string, we can form a subsequence of that string by deleting some number of characters \(possibly no deletions\).
>
> Given two strings `source` and `target`, return the minimum number of subsequences of `source` such that their concatenation equals `target`. If the task is impossible, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: source = "abc", target = "abcbc"
Output: 2
Explanation: The target "abcbc" can be formed by "abc" and "bc", which are subsequences of source "abc".
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: source = "abc", target = "acdbc"
Output: -1
Explanation: The target string cannot be constructed from the subsequences of source string due to the character "d" in target string.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: source = "xyz", target = "xzyxz"
Output: 3
Explanation: The target string can be constructed as follows "xz" + "y" + "xz".
```

**Constraints:**

* Both the `source` and `target` strings consist of only lowercase English letters from "a"-"z".
* The lengths of `source` and `target` string are between `1` and `1000`.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Optimum Solution 

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestWay(self, source: str, target: str) -> int:
        i, minimum = 0, 1
        
        for c in target:
            
            # Get leftmost char after previously matched index
            # Find the starting index in source then started from this index,
            # try to find next matched char
            i = source.find(c, i)
            
            # if not found, meaning up to this point this char does not exist in this substr,
            # therefore it needs to find from entire source
            if i == -1:
                
                i = source.find(c)
                minimum += 1
                
                if i == -1:
                    return -1
                
            i += 1
            
        return minimum
```
