# 721. Accounts Merge

## Descriptions

> Given a list `accounts`, each element `accounts[i]` is a list of strings, where the first element `accounts[i][0]` is a name, and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.
>
> Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some email that is common to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.
>
> After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails **in sorted order**. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.
>
> **Note:**
>
> The length of `accounts` will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.
>
> The length of `accounts[i]` will be in the range `[1, 10]`.
>
> The length of `accounts[i][j]` will be in the range `[1, 30]`.

**Examples:**

```
Input: 
accounts = [["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john00@mail.com"], ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"], ["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com"], ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]]

Output: [["John", 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com'],  ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"], ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]]

Explanation: 
The first and third John's are the same person as they have the common email "johnsmith@mail.com".
The second John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.
We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'], 
['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']] would still be accepted.
```

## **Approach \#1: Depth-First Search**

**Intuition**

Draw an edge between two emails if they occur in the same account. The problem comes down to finding connected components of this graph.



**Algorithm**

For each account, draw the edge from the first email to all other emails. Additionally, we'll remember a map from emails to names on the side. After finding each connected component using a depth-first search, we'll add that to our answer.

```
class Solution(object):
    def accountsMerge(self, accounts):
        em_to_name = {}
        graph = collections.defaultdict(set)
        for acc in accounts:
            name = acc[0]
            for email in acc[1:]:
                graph[acc[1]].add(email)
                graph[email].add(acc[1])
                em_to_name[email] = name

        seen = set()
        ans = []
        for email in graph:
            if email not in seen:
                seen.add(email)
                stack = [email]
                component = []
                while stack:
                    node = stack.pop()
                    component.append(node)
                    for nei in graph[node]:
                        if nei not in seen:
                            seen.add(nei)
                            stack.append(nei)
                ans.append([em_to_name[email]] + sorted(component))
        return ans
```

## **Approach \#2: Union-Find \[Accepted\]**

**Intuition**

As in _Approach \#1_, our problem comes down to finding the connected components of a graph. This is a natural fit for a _Disjoint Set Union_ \(DSU\) structure.

**Algorithm**

As in _Approach \#1_, draw edges between emails if they occur in the same account. For easier interoperability between our DSU template, we will map each email to some integer index by using `emailToID`. Then, `dsu.find(email)` will tell us a unique id representing what component that email is in.

```
class DSU:
    def __init__(self):
        self.parents = list(range(10001))
    def find(self, x):
        if self.parents[x] != x:
            self.parents[x] = self.find(self.parents[x])
        return self.parents[x]
    def union(self, x, y):
        self.parents[self.find(x)] = self.find(y)

class Solution:
    def accountsMerge(self, accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        dsu = DSU()
        email_to_name = {}
        email_to_id = {}
        i = 0
        for acc in accounts:
            name = acc[0]
            for email in acc[1:]:
                email_to_name[email] = name
                if email not in email_to_id:
                    email_to_id[email] = i
                    i += 1
                dsu.union(email_to_id[acc[1]], email_to_id[email])
        
        ans = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for email in email_to_name:
            ans[dsu.find(email_to_id[email])].append(email)
            
        return [[email_to_name[v[0]]] + sorted(v) for v in ans.values()]
```

## Approach \#4 Union Find without Separate Class \(with path compression and rank\)

```
class Solution:
    def accountsMerge(self, accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        if not accounts:
            return []
        # if use form of list as the parent map, then have to make sure the problem can be abstracted as INDEX based parent list
        parent = list(range(10001))
        rank = list(range(10001))
        
        def find(n):
            if parent[n] != n:
                parent[n] = find(parent[n])
            return parent[n]
        
        def union(x, y):
            parent_x = find(x)
            parent_y = find(y)
            
            if parent_x == parent_y:
                return
            if rank[parent_x] > rank[parent_y]:
                parent[parent_y] = parent[parent_x]
            else:
                parent[parent_x] = parent[parent_y]
                if rank[parent_x] == parent[parent_y]:
                    parent[parent_y] += 1
        
        em_to_name = {}
        em_to_id = {}
        i = 0 # index based id
        for acc in accounts:
            name = acc[0]
            for email in acc[1:]:
                em_to_name[email] = name
                if email not in em_to_id:
                    em_to_id[email] = i
                    i += 1
                # all accounts belongs to the same set, merge them by setting their
                # parent id to be the same id
                union(em_to_id[acc[1]], em_to_id[email])
        
        res = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for email in em_to_name:
            res[find(em_to_id[email])].append(email)
        
        return [[em_to_name[v[0]]] + sorted(v) for v in res.values()]
```

* [Pythonic list operations](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)
  * for email in acc\[1:\]
  * self.parents = list\(range\(10001\)\)
  * \[\[email\_to\_name\[v\[0\]\]\] + sorted\(v\) for v in ans.values\(\)\]
* Use emails as connections
  * Use emails to create ids and then use id as the tracking identity for union find
