# 298. Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence

> Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest consecutive sequence path.
>
> The path refers to any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The longest consecutive path need to be from parent to child \(cannot be the reverse\).
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
>
>    1
>     \
>      3
>     / \
>    2   4
>         \
>          5
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation: Longest consecutive sequence path is 3-4-5, so return 3.

> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
>
>    2
>     \
>      3
>     / 
>    2    
>   / 
>  1
>
> Output: 2 
>
> Explanation: Longest consecutive sequence path is 2-3, not 3-2-1, so return 2.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 BFS, Optimal solution

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        stack = [(root, 1)]
        max_len = 0
        while stack:
            node, max_path = stack.pop()
            if node.left:
                stack.append((node.left, max_path + 1 if node.left.val == node.val + 1 else 1))
            if node.right:
                stack.append((node.right, max_path + 1 if node.right.val == node.val + 1 else 1))
            max_len = max(max_len, max_path)
        return max_len
```
