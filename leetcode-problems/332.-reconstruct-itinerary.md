# 332. Reconstruct Itinerary

> Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports `[from, to]`, reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `JFK`. Thus, the itinerary must begin with `JFK`.
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.
> 2. All airports are represented by three capital letters \(IATA code\).
> 3. You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
> Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
> Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
> Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"].
>              But it is larger in lexical order.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Non Recursion DFS

```python
"""
Keys:
- Use up all tickets
"""
class Solution:
    def findItinerary(self, tickets: List[List[str]]) -> List[str]:
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for src, dst in tickets:
            graph[src].append(dst)
        for src in graph.keys():
            graph[src].sort(reverse=True) # 想的直接点 需要排序就排序
        stack = []
        res = []
        stack.append('JFK')
        while stack:
            last_dst = stack[-1]
            if last_dst in graph and len(graph[last_dst]) > 0:
                stack.append(graph[last_dst].pop()) # pop from graph to represent visited
            else:
                res.append(stack.pop())
        return res[::-1]
```

### Approach \#2 Recursion DFS

```python
class Solution:
    def findItinerary(self, tickets: List[List[str]]) -> List[str]:
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for frm, to in tickets:
            graph[frm].append(to)
        for frm, tos in graph.items():
            tos.sort(reverse=True)
        res = []
        self.dfs(graph, "JFK", res)
        return res[::-1]

    def dfs(self, graph, source, res):
        while graph[source]:
            v = graph[source].pop()
            self.dfs(graph, v, res)
        res.append(source)
```
