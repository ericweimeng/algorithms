# 523. Continuous Subarray Sum

> Given a list of **non-negative** numbers and a target **integer** k, write a function to check if the array has a continuous subarray of size at least 2 that sums up to a multiple of **k**, that is, sums up to n\*k where n is also an **integer**.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [23, 2, 4, 6, 7],  k=6
Output: True
Explanation: Because [2, 4] is a continuous subarray of size 2 and sums up to 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [23, 2, 6, 4, 7],  k=6
Output: True
Explanation: Because [23, 2, 6, 4, 7] is an continuous subarray of size 5 and sums up to 42.
```

**Note:**

1. The length of the array won't exceed 10,000.
2. You may assume the sum of all the numbers is in the range of a signed 32-bit integer.

## Solutions

Let see few examples before we reach to the conclusion:

Say, if k = 2, then we can see:

```text
if sum of one subarray = 3 then 3 % 2 == 1
if next sum of one subarray = 7 then 7 % 2 == 1
if next of next one subarray = 9 then 9 % 2 == 1
and in this case, difference between the sum of two subarray is 7 - 3 == 4 == 2 * k, 
9 - 7 == 2 == 1 * k
```

Based on above math truth we can conclude that if two sums of two subarray got the same reminder when both mod k, then the sum of subarray between index of previous position and index of current position can be divided by k, or to put it differently, the sum is n \* k.

## Approach \#1 Math

```python
class Solution:
    def checkSubarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        if not nums:
            return False
        r = 0
        seen = {0: -1}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            r = (r + num) % k if k else r + num
            if r not in seen: seen[r] = i
            if i - seen[r] > 1: return True
        
        return False
```

### Approach \#2 Prefix Sum

sum1 is sum of A\[0\] - A\[j\], sum2 is sum of A\[0\] - A\[i\] \(i &lt; j\)

\(sum1 - sum2\) % k == 0 =&gt; sum1 % k == sum2 % k

```python
class Solution:
    def checkSubarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        sums = {0: -1}
        cur = 0
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            cur += nums[i]
            if k:
                cur %= k
            if cur in sums: 
                if i - sums[cur] > 1:
                    return True
            else:
                sums[cur] = i
        return False
```
