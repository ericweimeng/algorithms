# 283. Move Zeroes

> Given an array `nums`, write a function to move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
> Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
> ```
>
> **Note**:
>
> 1. You must do this **in-place** without making a copy of the array.
> 2. Minimize the total number of operations.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Two Pointers, Optimal Solution

**Algorithm complexity:**  
_Time complexity: O\(n\)_. Our fast pointer does not visit the same spot twice.  
_Space complexity: O\(1\)_. All operations are made in-place

```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        i = j = 0
        while j < len(nums):
            if nums[j] != 0:
                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
            if nums[i] != 0:
                i +=1
            j += 1
```
