# 152. Maximum Product Subarray

> Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray within an array \(containing at least one number\) which has the largest product.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [2,3,-2,4]
> Output: 6
> Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [-2,0,-1]
> Output: 0
> Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
> ```

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Optimal solutions

1. Use an example: \[2,-3,4,-8,0\]
2. Insights: **What if the array has just positive numbers including zero**? A solution of this will maintain max\_prod\[i\] where max\_prod\[i\] is the maximum subarray product ending at i. Then max\_prod\[i+1\] = max\(max\_prod\[i\] \* nums\[i+1\], nums\[i+1\]\). **Now how do we change the solution when we allow negative numbers**? Imagine that we have both max\_prod\[i\] and min\_prod\[i\] i.e. max prod ending at i and min prod ending at i. Now if we have a negative number at nums\[i+1\] and if min\_prod\[i\] is negative, then the product of the two will be positive and can potentially be largest product. Key point is to maintain both max\_prod and min\_prod such that at iteration i, they refer to the max and min prod ending at index i -1.

You have three choices to make at any position in array.

1. You can get maximum product by multiplying the current element with maximum product calculated so far. \(might work when current element is positive\).
2. You can get maximum product by multiplying the current element with minimum product calculated so far. \(might work when current element is negative\).
3. Current element might be a starting position for maximum product sub array

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        max_prod, min_prod, res = nums[0], nums[0], nums[0]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            mx = max(nums[i], max_prod * nums[i], min_prod * nums[i])
            mi = min(nums[i], max_prod * nums[i], min_prod * nums[i])
            max_prod, min_prod = mx, mi # has to have
            res = max(res, max_prod)
        return res
```
