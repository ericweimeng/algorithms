# 198. House Robber

> You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.
>
> Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

## Approach \#1 DP

```
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        
        n = len(nums)
        if n == 1:
            return nums[0]
        
        dp = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dp[1] = nums[0]
        dp[2] = max(nums[0], nums[1])
        
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i - 1])
            
        return dp[n]
```
