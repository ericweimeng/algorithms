# 56. Merge Intervals

> Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
> Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
> Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
> Output: [[1,5]]
> Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1

```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if len(intervals) <= 1:
            return intervals
        intervals.sort()
        res = [intervals[0]]
        for interval in intervals[1:]:
            if interval[0] > res[-1][1]:
                res.append(interval)
            elif interval[0] <= res[-1][1] < interval[1]:
                res[-1][1] = interval[1]
        return res
```

### Stuck point

* not sure to compare two adjacent elements in intervals or other ways, but it should compare each interval in intervals with last element in res
