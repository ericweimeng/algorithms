# 1038. Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree

> Given the root of a binary **search** tree with distinct values, modify it so that every `node` has a new value equal to the sum of the values of the original tree that are greater than or equal to `node.val`.
>
> As a reminder, a _binary search tree_ is a tree that satisfies these constraints:
>
> * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
> * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
> * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

> Input: [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
> Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]

>
> **Constraints:**
>
> 1. The number of nodes in the tree is between `1` and `100`.
> 2. Each node will have value between `0` and `100`.
> 3. The given tree is a binary search tree.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1

```python
class Solution:
    def bstToGst(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        self.dfs(root, 0)
        return root
        
    def dfs(self, node, val):
        if not node:
            return val
        
        val = self.dfs(node.right, val)
        node.val += val
        return self.dfs(node.left, node.val)
```
