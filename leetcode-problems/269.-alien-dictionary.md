# 269. Alien Dictionary

> There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of **non-empty** words from the dictionary, where **words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language**. Derive the order of letters in this language.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> [
>   "wrt",
>   "wrf",
>   "er",
>   "ett",
>   "rftt"
> ]
>
> Output: "wertf"
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> [
>   "z",
>   "x"
> ]
>
> Output: "zx"
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> [
>   "z",
>   "x",
>   "z"
> ] 
>
> Output: "" 
>
> Explanation: The order is invalid, so return "".
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> * You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
> * If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
> * There may be multiple valid order of letters, return any one of them is fine.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Topological Sort, Optimal Solution

Time: O\(nm\)

Space: O\(nm\)

```python
class Solution:
    def alienOrder(self, words: List[str]) -> str:
        indegree = {c: 0 for w in words for c in w}
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for w1, w2 in zip(words, words[1:]):
            if len(w1) > len(w2) and w1[:len(w2)] == w2:
                return ''
            for c1, c2 in zip(w1, w2):
                if c1 != c2:
                    graph[c1].append(c2)
                    indegree[c2] += 1
                    break
        q = collections.deque([c for c, v in indegree.items() if v == 0])
        res = ''
        while q:
            c = q.popleft()
            res += c
            for nc in graph[c]:
                indegree[nc] -= 1
                if indegree[nc] == 0:
                    q.append(nc)
                    
        return res if len(res) == len(indegree) else ''
```
