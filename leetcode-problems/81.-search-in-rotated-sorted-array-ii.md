# 81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

> Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
>
> \(i.e., `[0,0,1,2,2,5,6]` might become `[2,5,6,0,0,1,2]`\).
>
> You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return `true`, otherwise return `false`.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
> Output: true
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
> Output: false
> ```
>
> **Follow up:**

> * This is a follow up problem to [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/), where `nums` may contain duplicates.
> * Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

## Solutions

### Approach \#1, Binary Search

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> bool:
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return True
            while l < mid and nums[l] == nums[mid]:
                l += 1
            if nums[l] <= nums[mid]:
                if nums[l] <= target < nums[mid]:
                    r = mid - 1
                else:
                    l = mid + 1
            else:
                if nums[mid] < target <= nums[r]:
                    l = mid + 1
                else:
                    r = mid
        return False
```
