# 265. Paint House II

> There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
>
> The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a `n x k` cost matrix. For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

**Note:**  
All costs are positive integers.

**Example:**

```text
Input: [[1,5,3],[2,9,4]]Output: 5Explanation: Paint house 0 into color 0, paint house 1 into color 2. Minimum cost: 1 + 4 = 5;              Or paint house 0 into color 2, paint house 1 into color 0. Minimum cost: 3 + 2 = 5. 
```

**Follow up:**  
Could you solve it in O\(nk\) runtime?

## Approach \#1 DP

```python
class Solution:    def minCostII(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:        if not costs:            return 0                n = len(costs)        K = len(costs[0])                if K == 1:            return costs[0][0]                dp = [[0 for _ in range(K)] for _ in range(n + 1)]                # previous first and second min_val        min1 = min2 = float('inf')        id1 = id2 = 0                for i in range(1, n + 1):            min1 = min2 = float('inf')            for j in range(K):                if dp[i - 1][j] < min1:                    min2 = min1                    id2 = id1                    min1 = dp[i - 1][j]                    id1 = j                else:                    if dp[i - 1][j] < min2:                        min2 = dp[i - 1][j]                        id2 = j                                    for j in range(K):                dp[i][j] = costs[i - 1][j]                if j != id1:                    dp[i][j] += min1                else:                    dp[i][j] += min2                            res = float('inf')        for i in range(K):            res = min(res, dp[n][i])                    return res
