# 503. Next Greater Element II

> Given a circular array \(the next element of the last element is the first element of the array\), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.
>
> **Example 1:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: [1,2,1]
> Output: [2,-1,2]
> Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
> The number 2 can't find next greater number; 
> The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
> ```
>
> **Note:** The length of given array won't exceed 10000.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Monotonic Stack

Time: O\(n\)

Space: O\(n\)

```python
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElements(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        if not nums:
            return []
        stack = []
        n = len(nums)
        res = [-1] * n
        for i in range(n * 2 - 1, -1, -1):
            # '=' 重要！元素相等但是index向前移动
            while stack and nums[i % n] >= nums[stack[-1]]:
                stack.pop()
            if stack:
                res[i % n] = nums[stack[-1]]
            stack.append(i % n)
        return res
```

#### Takeaways

* Mod
  * A % B can be seen as the reminder of A // B, and can also be interpreted as if use number of A item to fill in B size containers, the last container will have how many items inside. This is a way to map any number of A items to fixed length of B
  * If we have any circular iterators, may consider use mod to map to a certain index
* Even if two elements are equal, need to pop from the stack and add current, since it's asking for next greater one
