# 101. Symmetric Tree

> Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself \(ie, symmetric around its center\).

> For example, this binary tree `[1,2,2,3,4,4,3]` is symmetric:

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Recursion DFS

```python
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if not root:
            return True
        return self.dfs(root.left, root.right)

    def dfs(self, l, r):
        if l and r:
            return l.val == r.val and self.dfs(l.left, r.right) and self.dfs(l.right, r.left)
        return l == r
```
