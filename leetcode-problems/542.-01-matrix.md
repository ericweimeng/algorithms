# 542. 01 Matrix

> Given a matrix consists of 0 and 1, find the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.
>
> The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> [[0,0,0],
>  [0,1,0],
>  [0,0,0]]
>
> Output:
> [[0,0,0],
>  [0,1,0],
>  [0,0,0]]
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> [[0,0,0],
>  [0,1,0],
>  [1,1,1]]
>
> Output:
> [[0,0,0],
>  [0,1,0],
>  [1,2,1]]
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. The number of elements of the given matrix will not exceed 10,000.
> 2. There are at least one 0 in the given matrix.
> 3. The cells are adjacent in only four directions: up, down, left and right.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 BFS

```python
class Solution:
    def updateMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        m = len(matrix)
        n = len(matrix[0])
        q = collections.deque()
        res = [[-1 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
        dirs = ((-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1))
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                    res[i][j] = 0
                    q.append((i, j))
        
        while q:
            curi, curj = q.popleft()
            for i, j in dirs:
                ni = curi + i
                nj = curj + j
                if 0 <= ni < m and 0 <= nj < n and res[ni][nj] == -1:
                    res[ni][nj] = res[curi][curj] + 1
                    q.append((ni, nj))
        
        return res
```
