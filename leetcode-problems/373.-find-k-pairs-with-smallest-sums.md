# 373. Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums

> You are given two integer arrays **nums1** and **nums2** sorted in ascending order and an integer **k**.
>
> Define a pair **\(u,v\)** which consists of one element from the first array and one element from the second array.
>
> Find the k pairs **\(u1,v1\),\(u2,v2\) ...\(uk,vk\)** with the smallest sums.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: nums1 = [1,7,11], nums2 = [2,4,6], k = 3
> Output: [[1,2],[1,4],[1,6]] 
> Explanation: The first 3 pairs are returned from the sequence: 
>              [1,2],[1,4],[1,6],[7,2],[7,4],[11,2],[7,6],[11,4],[11,6]
> ```

> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: nums1 = [1,1,2], nums2 = [1,2,3], k = 2
> Output: [1,1],[1,1]
> Explanation: The first 2 pairs are returned from the sequence: 
>              [1,1],[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[1,2],[2,2],[1,3],[1,3],[2,3]

## Solutions

### Approach \#1, Priority queue, optimal solution

```text
      2   4   6
   +------------
 1 |  3   5   7
 7 |  9  11  13
11 | 13  15  17
```

Of course the smallest pair overall is in the top left corner, the one with sum 3. We don't even need to look anywhere else. After including that pair in the output, the next-smaller pair must be the next on the right \(sum=5\) or the next below \(sum=9\). We can keep a "horizon" of possible candidates, implemented as a heap / priority-queue, and roughly speaking we'll grow from the top left corner towards the right/bottom. 

It starts off only with the very first pair at the top-left corner of the matrix, and expands from there as needed. Whenever a pair is chosen into the output result, the next pair in the row gets added to the priority queue of current options. Also, if the chosen pair is the first one in its row, then the first pair in the next row is added to the queue.

Here's a visualization of a possible state:

```text
# # # # # ? . .
# # # ? . . . .
# ? . . . . . .   "#" means pair already in the output
# ? . . . . . .   "?" means pair currently in the queue
# ? . . . . . .
? . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . .
```

```python
class Solution:
    def kSmallestPairs(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        q = []
        def push(i, j):
            if i < len(nums1) and j < len(nums2):
                heapq.heappush(q, [nums1[i] + nums2[j], i, j])
        push(0, 0)
        res = []
        while q and len(res) < k:
            _, i, j = heapq.heappop(q)
            res.append([nums1[i], nums2[j]])
            push(i, j + 1)
            if j == 0:
                push(i + 1, 0)
        return res
```

#### Only push \(i, j + 1\) not \(i + 1, j\)

The problem can also be viewed as finding the kth smallest element from m sorted arrays. The 'bubbling' down process in your solution 5 can also be seen as keeping track of the smallest element in each array. The initialization of row 0 in your matrix is equivalent to getting the pointer set up for each array -- that explains why you don't need to push \(i+1, j \) into the heap for j &gt; 0, because the smallest element in the j column is already in the heap, and push \(i+1, j\) will cause redundancy and will need an additional data structure to label the elements that have been pushed once.
