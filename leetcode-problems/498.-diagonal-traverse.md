## Solutions

### Approach \#1

Since the iteration for a nested loop of a matrix is by nature going through each line, so for each diagonal line, the first element that is being accessed and add is the element on the top right for each diagonal line. 

How to add elements to its corresponding diagonal line?

After taking close look at the characteristics it's easy to find out that for indexes of all the elements in diagonal line, 

```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def findDiagonalOrder(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        m = defaultdict(list)
        if not matrix: return []
        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            for j in range(len(matrix[0])):
                m[i+j].append(matrix[i][j])
        for k in range(len(matrix) + len(matrix[0]) - 1):
            if k % 2 == 0:
                res += m[k][::-1]
            else:
                res += m[k]
        return res
```

### Approach \#2, optimal solution

We are going to go up-right or down-left position, but there are four edge cases need to be considered:

1. On top bolder in up trend: go right
2. On right bolder in up trend: go down
3. On left bolder in down trend: go down
4. On bottom bolder in down trend: go right

Itâ€™s noted that case 2 will take precedence of case 1 if you are on top-right corner exactly. And case 4 will take precedence of case 3 on bottom-left corner.

Watch out:

* increment correct index for row and col
* if you want to assign to list directly, initialize it first with a known size

```python
class Solution:
    def findDiagonalOrder(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
            return []
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        res = [0 for i in range(m*n)]
        up = True
        r = c = 0
        for i in range(m*n):
            res[i] = matrix[r][c]
            if up:
                if c == n - 1:
                    r += 1
                    up = not up
                elif r == 0:
                    c += 1
                    up = not up
                else:
                    r -= 1
                    c += 1
            else:
                if r == m - 1:
                    c += 1
                    up = not up
                elif c == 0:
                    r += 1
                    up = not up
                else:
                    r += 1
                    c -= 1
        return res
```
