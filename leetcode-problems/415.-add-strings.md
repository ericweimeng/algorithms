# 415. Add Strings

> Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented as string, return the sum of `num1` and `num2`.
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. The length of both `num1` and `num2` is &lt; 5100.
> 2. Both `num1` and `num2` contains only digits `0-9`.
> 3. Both `num1` and `num2` does not contain any leading zero.
> 4. You **must not use any built-in BigInteger library** or **convert the inputs to integer** directly.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1

```python
class Solution:
    def addStrings(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        n1, n2 = 0, 0
        for num in num1:
            n1 = n1 * 10 + ord(num) - 48
        for num in num2:
            n2 = n2 * 10 + ord(num) - 48
            
        return str(n1 + n2)
```
