# 337. House Robber III

> The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.
>
> Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
>
>      3
>     / \
>    2   3
>     \   \ 
>      3   1
>
> Output: 7 
> Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
>
>      3
>     / \
>    4   5
>   / \   \ 
>  1   3   1
>
> Output: 9
> Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 DFS

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        return max(self._rob(root))
        
    def _rob(self, root):
        
        if not root:
            return (0, 0)
        
        left = self._rob(root.left)
        right = self._rob(root.right)
        
        rob_cur = root.val + left[1] + right[1]
        rob_skip_cur = max(left) + max(right)
        
        return (rob_cur, rob_skip_cur)
```
