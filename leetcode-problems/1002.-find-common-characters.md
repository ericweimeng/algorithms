# 1002. Find Common Characters

> Given an array `A` of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list of all characters that show up in all strings within the list **\(including duplicates\)**.  For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all strings but not 4 times, you need to include that character three times in the final answer.
>
> You may return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: ["bella","label","roller"]
Output: ["e","l","l"]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: ["cool","lock","cook"]
Output: ["c","o"]
```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 100`
2. `1 <= A[i].length <= 100`
3. `A[i][j]` is a lowercase letter

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Rolling array

```python
class Solution:
    def commonChars(self, A: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        check = list(A[0])
        
        for word in A:
            cur_check = []
            for c in word:
                if c in check:
                    cur_check.append(c)
                    check.remove(c)
            check = cur_check
            
        return check
        
```
