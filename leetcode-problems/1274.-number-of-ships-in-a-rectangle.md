# 1274. Number of Ships in a Rectangle

> _\(This problem is an **interactive problem**.\)_
>
> On the sea represented by a cartesian plane, each ship is located at an integer point, and each integer point may contain at most 1 ship.
>
> You have a function `Sea.hasShips(topRight, bottomLeft)` which takes two points as arguments and returns `true` if and only if there is at least one ship in the rectangle represented by the two points, including on the boundary.
>
> Given two points, which are the top right and bottom left corners of a rectangle, return the number of ships present in that rectangle.  It is guaranteed that there are **at most 10 ships** in that rectangle.
>
> Submissions making **more than 400 calls** to `hasShips` will be judged _Wrong Answer_.  Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.
>
> **Example :**

> ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/07/26/1445_example_1.PNG)
>
> ```text
> Input: 
> ships = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[5,5]], topRight = [4,4], bottomLeft = [0,0]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: From [0,0] to [4,4] we can count 3 ships within the range.
> ```
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> * On the input `ships` is only given to initialize the map internally. You must solve this problem "blindfolded". In other words, you must find the answer using the given `hasShips` API, without knowing the `ships` position.
> * `0 <= bottomLeft[0] <= topRight[0] <= 1000`
> * `0 <= bottomLeft[1] <= topRight[1] <= 1000`

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Quadratic Search

```python
# """
# This is Sea's API interface.
# You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation
# """
#class Sea(object):
#    def hasShips(self, topRight: 'Point', bottomLeft: 'Point') -> bool:
#
#class Point(object):
#	def __init__(self, x: int, y: int):
#		self.x = x
#		self.y = y

class Solution(object):
    def countShips(self, sea: 'Sea', topRight: 'Point', bottomLeft: 'Point') -> int:
        res = 0
        if topRight.x >= bottomLeft.x and topRight.y >= bottomLeft.y and sea.hasShips(topRight, bottomLeft):
            if topRight.x == bottomLeft.x and topRight.y == bottomLeft.y:
                return 1
            mid_x, mid_y = (topRight.x + bottomLeft.x) // 2, (topRight.y + bottomLeft.y) // 2
            res += self.countShips(sea, topRight, Point(mid_x + 1, mid_y + 1))
            res += self.countShips(sea, Point(mid_x, mid_y), bottomLeft)
            res += self.countShips(sea, Point(mid_x, topRight.y), Point(bottomLeft.x, mid_y + 1))
            res += self.countShips(sea, Point(topRight.x, mid_y), Point(mid_x + 1, bottomLeft.y))
        
        return res
```
