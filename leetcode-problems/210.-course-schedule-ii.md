# 210. Course Schedule II

> There are a total of `n` courses you have to take labelled from `0` to `n - 1`.
>
> Some courses may have `prerequisites`, for example, if `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` this means you must take the course `bi` before the course `ai`.
>
> Given the total number of courses `numCourses` and a list of the `prerequisite` pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.
>
> If there are many valid answers, return **any** of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return **an empty array**.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
> Output: [0,1]
> Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
> Output: [0,2,1,3]
> Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
> So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
> Output: [0]
> ```
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> * `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
> * `0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)`
> * `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
> * `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
> * `ai != bi`
> * All the pairs `[ai, bi]` are **distinct**.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Topological Sort

Time: O\(V + E\)

Space: O\(V + E\)

```python
import collections
class Solution:
    def findOrder(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        indegree = {c : 0 for c in range(numCourses)}
        
        for c, prereq in prerequisites:
            graph[prereq].append(c)
            indegree[c] += 1
            
        q = collections.deque([c for c, prereq in indegree.items() if prereq == 0])
        
        res = []
        while q:
            c = q.popleft()
            res.append(c)
            for nc in graph[c]:
                indegree[nc] -= 1
                if indegree[nc] == 0:
                    q.append(nc)
                    
        return res if len(res) == numCourses else []
