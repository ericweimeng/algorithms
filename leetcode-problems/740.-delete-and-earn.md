# 740. Delete and Earn

> Given an array `nums` of integers, you can perform operations on the array.
>
> In each operation, you pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. After, you must delete **every** element equal to `nums[i] - 1` or `nums[i] + 1`.
>
> You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [3, 4, 2]Output: 6Explanation: Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points. 6 total points are earned.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]Output: 9Explanation: Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.9 total points are earned.
```

## Solutions

This question can be reduced to the [House Robbers question](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/) also on LeetCode. Please have a look at it if you haven't seen it before.

Observations:

* The order of `nums` does not matter.
* Once we decide that we want a `num`, we can add all the occurrences of `num` into the total.

We first transform the `nums` array into a `points` array that sums up the total number of points for that particular value. A value of `x` will be assigned to index `x` in `points`.

`nums`: `[2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]` \(2 appears 2 times, 3 appears 3 times, 4 appears once\)  
`points`: `[0, 0, 4, 9, 4]` &lt;- This is the gold in each house!

The condition that we cannot pick adjacent values is similar to the House Robber question that we cannot rob adjacent houses. Simply pass `points` into the `rob` function for a quick win 🌝!

```python
class Solution:    def deleteAndEarn(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:        if not nums:            return 0        occr = collections.Counter(nums)        keys = sorted(occr.keys())        prev = 0 # dp[0]        cur = keys[0] * occr[keys[0]] # dp[1]                for i in range(1, len(keys)):            if keys[i] - keys[i - 1] == 1:                prev, cur = cur, max(prev + keys[i] * occr[keys[i]], cur)            else:                prev, cur = cur, cur + keys[i] * occr[keys[i]]                        return cur
```
