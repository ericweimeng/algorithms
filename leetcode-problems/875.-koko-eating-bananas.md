# 875. Koko Eating Bananas

> Koko loves to eat bananas.  There are `N` piles of bananas, the `i`-th pile has `piles[i]` bananas.  The guards have gone and will come back in `H` hours.
>
> Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `K`.  Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas, and eats K bananas from that pile.  If the pile has less than `K` bananas, she eats all of them instead, and won't eat any more bananas during this hour.
>
> Koko likes to eat slowly, but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards come back.
>
> Return the minimum integer `K` such that she can eat all the bananas within `H` hours.

> **Example 1:**

> Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], H = 8
> Output: 4

> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], H = 5
> Output: 30
> ```

> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], H = 6
> Output: 23

> **Note:**
>
> * `1 <= piles.length <= 10^4`
> * `piles.length <= H <= 10^9`
> * `1 <= piles[i] <= 10^9`

### Approach \#1

```python
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], H: int) -> int:
        l, r = 1, max(piles)
        while l < r:
            m, hours = (l + r) // 2, 0
            for p in piles:
                hours += math.ceil(p / m)
            if hours > H:
                l = m + 1
            else:
                r = m
        return l
```
