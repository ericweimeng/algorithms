# 238. Product of Array Except Self

> Given an array `nums` of _n_ integers where _n_ &gt; 1,  return an array `output` such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> Input:  [1,2,3,4]
> Output: [24,12,8,6]
> ```
>
> **Constraint:** It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of the array \(including the whole array\) fits in a 32 bit integer.
>
> **Note:** Please solve it **without division** and in O\(_n_\).
>
> **Follow up:**  
> Could you solve it with constant space complexity? \(The output array **does not** count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.\)

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Optimal solution

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        l = len(nums)
        res = [0] * l
        res[0] = 1
        for i in range(1, l):
            res[i] = nums[i-1] * res[i-1]
        R = 1
        for i in range(l-1, -1, -1): # it's best to specify each step when reverse
            res[i] *= R
            R *= nums[i]
        return res
```
