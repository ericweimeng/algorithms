# 1213. Intersection of Three Sorted Arrays

> Given three integer arrays `arr1`, `arr2` and `arr3` **sorted** in **strictly increasing** order, return a sorted array of **only** the integers that appeared in **all** three arrays.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5], arr2 = [1,2,5,7,9], arr3 = [1,3,4,5,8]
> Output: [1,5]
> Explanation: Only 1 and 5 appeared in the three arrays.
> ```
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> * `1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length, arr3.length <= 1000`
> * `1 <= arr1[i], arr2[i], arr3[i] <= 2000`

## Solutions

### Approach \#1

```python
class Solution:
    def arraysIntersection(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int], arr3: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        arr_2 = set(arr2)
        arr_3 = set(arr3)
        for num in arr1:
            if num in arr_2 and num in arr_3:
                res.append(num)
        return res
```

### Takeaways

* Sets are created through set\(\) function. An Empty list is created. Note that empty Set cannot be created through {}, it creates dictionary. If use {}, upon initialization, it has to have at least one initial element.
* Convert a list to set take O\(n\), check if an item in list takes O\(n\)
* Set operations
  * \| for union. 
  * & for intersection. 
  * â€“ for difference 
  * ^ for symmetric difference
