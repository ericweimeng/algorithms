# 348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe

> Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.
>
> You may assume the following rules:
>
> 1. A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
> 2. Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
> 3. A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
>
> **Example:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.
>
> TicTacToe toe = new TicTacToe(3);
>
> toe.move(0, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
> |X| | |
> | | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
> | | | |
>
> toe.move(0, 2, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
> |X| |O|
> | | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
> | | | |
>
> toe.move(2, 2, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
> |X| |O|
> | | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
> | | |X|
>
> toe.move(1, 1, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
> |X| |O|
> | |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
> | | |X|
>
> toe.move(2, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
> |X| |O|
> | |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
> |X| |X|
>
> toe.move(1, 0, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
> |X| |O|
> |O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
> |X| |X|
>
> toe.move(2, 1, 1); -> Returns 1 (player 1 wins)
> |X| |O|
> |O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
> |X|X|X|

```python

        @return The current winning condition, can be either:
