# 286. Walls and Gates

> ## You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.
>
> 1. `-1` - A wall or an obstacle.
> 2. `0` - A gate.
> 3. `INF` - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value `231 - 1 = 2147483647` to represent `INF` as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than `2147483647`.
>
> Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with `INF`.
>
> **Example:** 
>
> Given the 2D grid:
>
> ```text
> INF  -1  0  INF
> INF INF INF  -1
> INF  -1 INF  -1
>   0  -1 INF INF
> ```
>
> After running your function, the 2D grid should be:
>
> ```text
>   3  -1   0   1
>   2   2   1  -1
>   1  -1   2  -1
>   0  -1   3   4
> ```

## Solutions

### Approach \#1, BFS

```python
class Solution:
    def wallsAndGates(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify rooms in-place instead.
        """
        if not rooms or not rooms[0]:
            return []
        r, c = len(rooms), len(rooms[0])
        q = collections.deque([])
        for i in range(r):
            for j in range(c):
                if rooms[i][j] == 0:
                    q.append((0, i, j))
        visited = [[0 for _ in range(c)] for _ in range(r)]
        while q:
            d, x, y = q.popleft()
            rooms[x][y] = d
            for nx, ny in ((x + 1, y), (x - 1, y), (x, y + 1), (x, y - 1)):
                if 0 <= nx < r and 0 <= ny < c and rooms[nx][ny] is not -1 and rooms[nx][ny] is not 0 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                    visited[nx][ny] = 1
                    q.append((d + 1, nx, ny))
```
