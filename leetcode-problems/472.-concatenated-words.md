# 472. Concatenated Words

> Given a list of words \(**without duplicates**\), please write a program that returns all concatenated words in the given list of words.
>
> A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array.
>
> **Example:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]
>
> Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]
>
> Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
>  "dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
> "ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".
> ```
>
> **Note:**  
>
>
> 1. The number of elements of the given array will not exceed `10,000`
> 2. The length sum of elements in the given array will not exceed `600,000`.
> 3. All the input string will only include lower case letters.
> 4. The returned elements order does not matter.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 DFS, Optimal Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        res = []
        words_dict = set(words)
        for word in words:
            words_dict.remove(word)
            if self.check(word, words_dict):
                res.append(word)
            words_dict.add(word)
        return res
    
    def check(self, word, d):
        if word in d:
            return True
        
        for i in range(len(word), 0, -1):
            if word[:i] in d and self.check(word[i:], d):
                return True
        
        return False
```
