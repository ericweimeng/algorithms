# 9. Palindrome Number

> Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: 121
> Output: true
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: -121
> Output: false
> Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input: 10
> Output: false
> Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
> ```

> Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

## Solutions

### Approach \#1

Time: O\(n\)

Space: O\(1\)

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        if x < 0:
            return False
        origin_num = x
        new_x = 0
        while x > 0:
            new_x = new_x * 10 + x % 10
            x //= 10
        return origin_num == new_x
```
