# 443. String Compression

> Given an array of characters, compress it [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm).
>
> The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.
>
> Every element of the array should be a **character** \(not int\) of length 1.
>
> After you are done **modifying the input array** [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm), return the new length of the array. 
>
> **Follow up:**  
> Could you solve it using only O\(1\) extra space?

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

Output:
Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

Explanation:
"aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input:
["a"]

Output:
Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]

Explanation:
Nothing is replaced.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input:
["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]

Output:
Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].

Explanation:
Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12".
Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.
```

**Note:**

1. All characters have an ASCII value in `[35, 126]`.
2. `1 <= len(chars) <= 1000`.

## Solutions

```python
class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, 0
        while right < len(chars):
            chars[left] = chars[right]
            count = 1
            
            while right + 1 < len(chars) and chars[right] == chars[right + 1]:
                right += 1
                count += 1
                
            if count > 1:
                # count could be a number greater than 9
                for c in str(count):
                    chars[left + 1] = c
                    left += 1
                    
            left += 1
            right += 1
            
        return left
        
```
