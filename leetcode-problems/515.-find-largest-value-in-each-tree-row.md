## Solutions

### Approach \#1 DFS

Time: O\(n\)

Space: O\(h\)

```python
class Solution:
    def largestValues(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
        if not root:
            return []
        res = []
        self.dfs(root, 0, res)
        return res
        
    def dfs(self, root, level, res):
        if level >= len(res):
            res.append(root.val)
        else:
            res[level] = max(res[level], root.val)
        if root.left:
            self.dfs(root.left, level + 1, res)
        if root.right:
            self.dfs(root.right, level + 1, res)
```

### Approach \#2 BFS

Time: O\(n\)

Space: O\(n\)

In a tree with n nodes, there's no possible way that you can ever get any more than n nodes into the queue at any one time, since no node will ever be enqueued twice. This gives an immediate upper bound of O\(n\). This isn't a tight bound, though, since if the tree is a **degenerate linked list** then the memory usage will just be O\(1\).

Your upper bound of O\(2h\) is also correct, but it's a weaker upper bound. In a tree with height h, there can be _at most_ 2h nodes in the bottom layer, but there's no guarantee that this is actually the case. If the tree is a degenerate linked list, the height is O\(n\), and your bound of O\(2h\) will exponentially over estimate the memory usage. Therefore here, O\(n\) is a better upper bound

```python
class Solution:
    def largestValues(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
        if not root:
            return []
        q = collections.deque([root])
        res = []
        while q:
            n = len(q)
            max_num = float('-inf')
            for _ in range(n):
                node = q.popleft()
                max_num = max(max_num, node.val)
                if node.left:
                    q.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    q.append(node.right)
            res.append(max_num)
        return res
```
