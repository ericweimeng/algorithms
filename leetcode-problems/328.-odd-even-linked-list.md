# 328. Odd Even Linked List

> Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.
>
> You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O\(1\) space complexity and O\(nodes\) time complexity.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
> Output: 1->3->5->2->4->NULL
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: 2->1->3->5->6->4->7->NULL
> Output: 2->3->6->7->1->5->4->NULL
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> * The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
> * The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...

## Solutions

### Approach \#1

开始两个头指向起始奇偶点，然后开始同时遍历，每次操作奇偶点各自指向其之后对应奇偶点，交换完当前操作后其所有前面点奇偶分离。

Time: O\(n\)

Space: O\(1\)

```python
class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if not head or not head.next or not head.next.next:
            return head
        pre, cur, even = head, head.next, head.next
        while cur and cur.next:
            tmp = cur.next
            cur.next = cur.next.next
            pre.next = tmp
            pre = pre.next
            cur = cur.next
        pre.next = even
        return head
```
