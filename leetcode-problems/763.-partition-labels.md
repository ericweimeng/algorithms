# 763. Partition Labels

> A string `S` of lowercase letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.
>
> **Example 1:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
> Output: [9,7,8]
> Explanation:
> The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
> This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
> A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
> ```
>
> **Note:**  
>
>
> 1. `S` will have length in range `[1, 500]`.
> 2. `S` will consist of lowercase letters \(`'a'` to `'z'`\) only.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1, hashmap

Time: O\(n\)

Space: O\(n\)

We traverse the list of characters and record its last index denotes that if we do partition include this character, the last index we need to include. If current index is not equal to the last index we need to include, then we increment the length for current partition.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def partitionLabels(self, S):
        if not S:
            return []
        res = []
        last_seen = {}
        max_last_seen = 0
        count = 0
        for i, c in enumerate(S):
            last_seen[c] = i
        for i, c in enumerate(S):
            max_last_seen = max(max_last_seen, last_seen[c])
            count += 1
            if i == max_last_seen:
                res.append(count)
                count = 0
        return res
```

## Variations

print out a list of partitioned strings

```python
def partitionString(S):
    """
    :type input: str
    :rtype: List[str]
    """
    if not S:
        return []
    res = []
    last_seen = {}
    max_last_seen = 0
    left = 0
    for i, c in enumerate(S):
        last_seen[c] = i
    for i, c in enumerate(S):
        max_last_seen = max(max_last_seen, last_seen[c])
        if i == max_last_seen:
            res.append(S[left:max_last_seen+1])
            left = i + 1
    return res
```
