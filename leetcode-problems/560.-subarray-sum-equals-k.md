# 560. Subarray Sum Equals K

> Given an array of integers and an integer **k**, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to **k**.

**Example 1:**  


```text
Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
```

**Note:**  


1. The length of the array is in range \[1, 20,000\].
2. The range of numbers in the array is \[-1000, 1000\] and the range of the integer **k** is \[-1e7, 1e7\].

## Solutions

With subarray, meaning nums\[i\] - nums\[j\], 0 &lt;= i &lt;= j &lt; len\(nums\). A direct, naive way to solve this will be use a brute force way to find all possible subarray and sum all elements of each subarray to see if the sum equals K. This would be o\(n\*\*3\).

Retrospect this solution, will can see many repeated calculations like i - j we do sum calculation on all i - j elements, when it comes to i - j + 1, we do the repeated calculations for i - j, actually in this case we only have one new element added to the previous i - j sum.

Therefore if we know the sum for 0 - i - 1 without calculation, then the sum of i - j will be sum\(0 - j\) - sum\(0 - i - 1\).

sum\(i,j\) = sum\(0, j\) - sum\(0, i - 1\), and if we know how many prefix sums up to j, then if sum\(i - j\) = K, we can get equation:

sum\(0, i - 1\) = sum\(0, j\) - K

### Approach \#1, prefix sum, optimal solution

```python
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        sums, res, sm = {}, 0, 0
        for num in nums:
            sums[sm], sm = sm in sums and sums[sm] + 1 or 1, sm + num
            if sm - k in sums: res += sums[sm - k]
        return res
```

### Approach \#2

Let's remember count\[V\], the number of previous prefix sums with value V. If our newest prefix sum has value W, and W-V == K, then we add count\[V\] to our answer.

This is because at time t, `A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[t-1] = W`, and there are `count[V]` indices `j` with `j < t-1` and `A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[j] = V`. Thus, there are `count[V]` subarrays `A[j+1] + A[j+2] + ... + A[t-1] = K`.

```python
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        count = total = 0
        cache = collections.defaultdict(int)
        cache[0] = 1
        for num in nums:
            total += num
            count += cache[total - k]
            cache[total] += 1
            
        return count
```
