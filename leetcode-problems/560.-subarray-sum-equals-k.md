# 560. Subarray Sum Equals K

> Given an array of integers and an integer **k**, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to **k**.

**Example 1:**  


```text
Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
```

**Note:**  


1. The length of the array is in range \[1, 20,000\].
2. The range of numbers in the array is \[-1000, 1000\] and the range of the integer **k** is \[-1e7, 1e7\].

## Solutions

Let's remember count\[V\], the number of previous prefix sums with value V. If our newest prefix sum has value W, and W-V == K, then we add count\[V\] to our answer.

This is because at time t, `A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[t-1] = W`, and there are `count[V]` indices `j` with `j < t-1` and `A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[j] = V`. Thus, there are `count[V]` subarrays `A[j+1] + A[j+2] + ... + A[t-1] = K`.

```python
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        count = total = 0
        cache = collections.defaultdict(int)
        cache[0] = 1
        for num in nums:
            total += num
            count += cache[total - k]
            cache[total] += 1
            
        return count
```
