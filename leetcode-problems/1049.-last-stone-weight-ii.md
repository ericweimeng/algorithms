# 1049. Last Stone Weight II

> We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.
>
> Each turn, we choose **any two rocks** and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`.  The result of this smash is:
>
> * If `x == y`, both stones are totally destroyed;
> * If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y-x`.
>
> At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the **smallest possible** weight of this stone \(the weight is 0 if there are no stones left.\)

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,
we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the optimal value.
```

## Approach \#1 DP

```
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        
        if not stones:
            return 0
        
        n = len(stones)
        
        dp = [[]]
        dp[0] = [stones[0], stones[0] * (-1)]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp.append([stone + stones[i] for stone in dp[i - 1]] + [stone - stones[i] for stone in dp[i - 1]])
            dp[i] = list(set(dp[i]))    
        total = list(set(abs(stone) for stone in dp[-1]))
        total.sort()
        return total[0]
