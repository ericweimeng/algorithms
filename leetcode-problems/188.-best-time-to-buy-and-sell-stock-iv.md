# 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

> Say you have an array for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i.
>
> Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most **k** transactions.
>
> **Note:**  
> You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time \(ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again\).

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4.
             Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
```

## Approach \#1 DP

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, k: int, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if not prices:
            return 0
        
        n = len(prices)
        if k > n // 2:
            # best time to sell stock ii
            # can make any times of transactions
            sum = 0
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if prices[i + 1] > prices[i]:
                    sum += prices[i + 1] - prices[i]
                    
            return sum
        
        dp = [[float('-inf') for _ in range(2*k + 2)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dp[0][1] = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            # phase 1, 3, 5..., 2k + 1
            for j in range(1, 2 * k + 2, 2):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
                if j > 1 and i >= 2 and dp[i - 1][j - 1] is not float('-inf'):
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - 1] + prices[i - 1] - prices[i - 2])
            
            # phase 2, 4, 2k
            for j in range(2, 2 * k + 1, 2):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
                if i >= 2 and dp[i - 1][j] is not float('inf'):
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j] + prices[i - 1] - prices[i - 2])
                    
                    
        res = float('-inf')
        for i in range(1, 2 * k + 2, 2):
            res = max(res, dp[n][i])
            
        return res
