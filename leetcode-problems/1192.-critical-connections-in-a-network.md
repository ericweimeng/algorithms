# 1192. Critical Connections in a Network

> There are `n` servers numbered from `0` to `n-1` connected by undirected server-to-server `connections` forming a network where `connections[i] = [a, b]` represents a connection between servers `a` and `b`. Any server can reach any other server directly or indirectly through the network.
>
> A _critical connection_ is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server.
>
> Return all critical connections in the network in any order.
>
> **Example 1:**

> Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
> Output: [[1,3]]
> Explanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted.

>
> **Constraints:**
>
> * `1 <= n <= 10^5`
> * `n-1 <= connections.length <= 10^5`
> * `connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]`
> * There are no repeated connections.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 DFS

```python
class Solution:
    def criticalConnections(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        graph = [[] for _ in range(n)] ## vertex i ==> [its neighbors]
        cur_rank = 0 ## please note this rank is NOT the num (name) of the vertex itself, it is the order of your DFS level
        lowest_rank = [i for i in range(n)] ## here lowestRank[i] represents the lowest order of vertex that can reach this vertex i
        visited = [False for _ in range(n)]
        
        # build graph
        for conn in connections:
            graph[conn[0]].append(conn[1])
            graph[conn[1]].append(conn[0])
            
        res = []
        pre_vertex = -1 ## This -1 a dummy. Does not really matter in the beginning. 
		## It will be used in the following DFS because we need to know where the current DFS level comes from. 
		## You do not need to setup this parameter, I setup here ONLY because it is more clear to see what are passed on in the DFS method.
        cur_vertex = 0 ## we start the DFS from vertex num 0 (its rank is also 0 of course)
        self.dfs(res, graph, lowest_rank, visited, cur_rank, pre_vertex, cur_vertex)
        return res
    
    def dfs(self, res, graph, lowest_rank, visited, cur_rank, pre_vertex, cur_vertex):
        visited[cur_vertex] = True
        lowest_rank[cur_vertex] = cur_rank
        for next_vertex in graph[cur_vertex]:
            if next_vertex == pre_vertex:
                continue
            if not visited[next_vertex]:
                self.dfs(res, graph, lowest_rank, visited, cur_rank + 1, cur_vertex, next_vertex)
                
            lowest_rank[cur_vertex] = min(lowest_rank[cur_vertex], lowest_rank[next_vertex])
            if lowest_rank[next_vertex] >= cur_rank + 1:
                res.append([cur_vertex, next_vertex])
```
