# 1254. Number of Closed Islands

> Given a 2D `grid` consists of `0s` \(land\) and `1s` \(water\).  An _island_ is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of `0s` and a _closed island_ is an island **totally** \(all left, top, right, bottom\) surrounded by `1s.`
>
> Return the number of _closed islands_.
>
> **Example 1:**

> ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/31/sample_3_1610.png)
>
> ```text
> Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]
> Output: 2
> Explanation: 
> Islands in gray are closed because they are completely surrounded by water (group of 1s).

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 DFS

```python
class Solution:
    def closedIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
            return 0
        
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if (i == 0 or j == 0 or i == m - 1 or j == n - 1) and grid[i][j] == 0:
                    self.dfs(grid, i, j)
                    
        self.res = 0
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 0:
                    self.dfs(grid, i, j)
                    self.res += 1
            
        return self.res
        
    def dfs(self, grid, i, j):
        if 0 <= i < len(grid) and 0 <= j < len(grid[0]) and grid[i][j] == 0:
            grid[i][j] = 1
            self.dfs(grid, i + 1, j)
            self.dfs(grid, i - 1, j)
            self.dfs(grid, i, j + 1)
            self.dfs(grid, i, j - 1)
```
