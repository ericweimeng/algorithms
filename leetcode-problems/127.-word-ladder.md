# 127. Word Ladder

> Given two words \(_beginWord_ and _endWord_\), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from _beginWord_ to _endWord_, such that:
>
> 1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
> 2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list.
>
> **Note:**
>
> * Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
> * All words have the same length.
> * All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
> * You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
> * You may assume _beginWord_ and _endWord_ are non-empty and are not the same.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> beginWord = "hit",
> endWord = "cog",
> wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
>
> Output: 5
>
> Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
> return its length 5.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> beginWord = "hit"
> endWord = "cog"
> wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 BFS

```python
class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
        wl = set(wordList)
        q = collections.deque([beginWord])
        level = 0
        
        while q:
            size = len(q)
            for i in range(size):
                s = q.popleft()
                if s == endWord:
                    return level + 1
                words = list(s)
                for j in range(len(words)):
                    tmp = words[j]
                    for k in range(97, 123):
                        if chr(k) != tmp:
                            words[j] = chr(k)
                        new_s = ''.join(words)
                        if new_s in wl:
                            q.append(new_s)
                            wl.remove(new_s)
                    words[j] = tmp
            level += 1
            
        return 0
