# 1268. Search Suggestions System

> Given an array of strings `products` and a string `searchWord`. We want to design a system that suggests at most three product names from `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with the searchWord. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.
>
> Return _list of lists_ of the suggested `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed. 
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"
> Output: [
> ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
> ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
> ["mouse","mousepad"],
> ["mouse","mousepad"],
> ["mouse","mousepad"]
> ]
> Explanation: products sorted lexicographically = ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"]
> After typing m and mo all products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"]
> After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"]
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"
> Output: [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input: products = ["bags","baggage","banner","box","cloths"], searchWord = "bags"
> Output: [["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags"],["bags"]]
> ```
>
> **Example 4:**
>
> ```text
> Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "tatiana"
> Output: [[],[],[],[],[],[],[]]
> ```
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> * `1 <= products.length <= 1000`
> * There are no repeated elements in `products`.
> * `1 <= Î£ products[i].length <= 2 * 10^4`
> * All characters of `products[i]` are lower-case English letters.
> * `1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000`
> * All characters of `searchWord` are lower-case English letters.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1, Binary search, optimal solution

#### **Intuition**

In a sorted list of words,  
for any word `A[i]`,  
all its sugested words must following this word in the list.

For example, if `A[i]` is a prefix of `A[j]`,  
A\[i\] must be the prefix of `A[i + 1], A[i + 2], ..., A[j]`

#### **Explanation**

With this observation,  
we can binary search the position of each prefix of search `word`,  
and check if the next 3 words is a valid suggestion.

#### **Complexity**

Time `O(NlogN)` for sorting  
Space `O(logN)` for quick sort.

Time `O(logN)` for each query  
Space `O(query)` for each query  
where I take word operation as `O(1)`

```python
import bisect
class Solution:
    def suggestedProducts(self, products: List[str], searchWord: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        products.sort()
        res, prefix, i = [], '', 0
        for c in searchWord:
            prefix += c
            i = bisect.bisect_left(products, prefix, i)
            res.append([w for w in products[i: i + 3] if w.startswith(prefix)])
        return res
```

```python
import bisect
class Solution:
def suggestedProducts(self, products: List[str], searchWord: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        products.sort()
        res = []
        key = ''
        for c in searchWord:
            key += c
            idx = bisect.bisect_left(products, key)
            res.append([products[i] for i in range(idx, min(len(products), idx + 3)) if products[i].startswith(key)])
        return res
```
