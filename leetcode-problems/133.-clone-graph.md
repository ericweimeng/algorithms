# 133. Clone Graph

> Given a reference of a node in a [**connected**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_%28graph_theory%29#Connected_graph) undirected graph.
>
> Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) \(clone\) of the graph.
>
> Each node in the graph contains a val \(`int`\) and a list \(`List[Node]`\) of its neighbors.
>
> ```text
> class Node {
>     public int val;
>     public List<Node> neighbors;
> }
> ```
>
> **Test case format:**
>
> For simplicity sake, each node's value is the same as the node's index \(1-indexed\). For example, the first node with `val = 1`, the second node with `val = 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.
>
> **Adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.
>
> The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.
>
> **Example 1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133_clone_graph_question.png)
>
> ```text
> Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
> Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
> Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
> 1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
> 2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
> 3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
> 4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph.png)
>
> ```text
> Input: adjList = [[]]
> Output: [[]]
> Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input: adjList = []
> Output: []
> Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
> ```
>
> **Example 4:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph-1.png)
>
> ```text
> Input: adjList = [[2],[1]]
> Output: [[2],[1]]
> ```
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> * `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
> * `Node.val` is unique for each node.
> * Number of Nodes will not exceed 100.
> * There is no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
> * The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

### Approach \#1 DFS

Time O\(n\)

Space O\(n\)

```python
class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not node:
            return node
        visited = {node: Node(node.val)}
        stack = [node]
        while stack:
            cur = stack.pop()
            for nei in cur.neighbors:
                if nei not in visited:
                    visited[nei] = Node(nei.val)
                    stack.append(nei)
