# 969. Pancake Sorting

> Given an array `A`, we can perform a _pancake flip_: We choose some positive integer **`k`** `<= A.length`, then reverse the order of the first **k** elements of `A`.  We want to perform zero or more pancake flips \(doing them one after another in succession\) to sort the array `A`.
>
> Return the k-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort `A`.  Any valid answer that sorts the array within `10 * A.length` flips will be judged as correct.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [3,2,4,1]
> Output: [4,2,4,3]
> Explanation: 
> We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.
> Starting state: A = [3, 2, 4, 1]
> After 1st flip (k=4): A = [1, 4, 2, 3]
> After 2nd flip (k=2): A = [4, 1, 2, 3]
> After 3rd flip (k=4): A = [3, 2, 1, 4]
> After 4th flip (k=3): A = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted. 
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [1,2,3]
> Output: []
> Explanation: The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.
> Note that other answers, such as [3, 3], would also be accepted.
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. `1 <= A.length <= 100`
> 2. `A[i]` is a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., A.length]`

        res = []
        for i in range(n):
            cur_max = max(A[:n - i])
            j = 0
            while A[j] != cur_max:
                j += 1
            # should reverse j+1 elements
            A[:j + 1] = reversed(A[:j + 1])
            res.append(j + 1)
            # reverse all
            A[:n - i] = reversed(A[:n - i])
            res.append(n - i)
