# 11. Container With Most Water

> Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate \(i, ai\). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at \(i, ai\) and \(i, 0\). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
>
> **Note:** You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

>
> The above vertical lines are represented by array \[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7\]. In this case, the max area of water \(blue section\) the container can contain is 49.

## Solutions

O\(n\), O\(1\)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        i, j = 0, len(height) - 1
        while i < j:
            res = max(res, min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i))
            if height[i] < height[j]:
                i += 1
            else:
                j -= 1
        return res
```
