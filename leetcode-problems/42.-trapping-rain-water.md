> The above elevation map is represented by array \[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1\]. In this case, 6 units of rain water \(blue section\) are being trapped. **Thanks Marcos** for contributing this image!

## **Approach 3: Using stacks**

**Intuition**

Instead of storing the largest bar upto an index as in [Approach 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/solution/#approach-2-dynamic-programming), we can use stack to keep track of the bars that are bounded by longer bars and hence, may store water. Using the stack, we can do the calculations in only one iteration.

We keep a stack and iterate over the array. We add the index of the bar to the stack if bar is smaller than or equal to the bar at top of stack, which means that the current bar is bounded by the previous bar in the stack. If we found a bar longer than that at the top, we are sure that the bar at the top of the stack is bounded by the current bar and a previous bar in the stack, hence, we can pop it and add resulting trapped water to \text{ans}ans.

**Algorithm**

* Use stack to store the indices of the bars.
* Iterate the array:
  * While stack is not empty and height\[current\]&gt;height\[st.top\(\)\]
    * It means that the stack element can be popped. Pop the top element as top.
    * Find the distance between the current element and the element at top of stack, which is to be filled. distance = current − st.top\(\) − 1
    * Find the bounded height, bounded\_height = min\(height\[current\], height\[st.top\(\)\]\) − height\[top\]
    * Add resulting trapped water to answer, ans += distance × bounded\_height
  * Push current index to top of the stack
  * Move current to the next position

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        if not height:
            return 0
        
        # Monotonuous stack
        stack = []
        res, current = 0, 0
        
        while current < len(height):
            while stack and height[current] > height[stack[-1]]:
                top = stack[-1]
                stack.pop()
                if not stack:
                    break
                distance = current - stack[-1] - 1
                bounded_height = min(height[current], height[stack[-1]]) - height[top]
                res += distance * bounded_height
                            
            stack.append(current)
            current += 1
        
        return res
```
