# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence

> Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence.
>
> A _subsequence_ of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters\(can be none\) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. \(eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not\). A _common subsequence_ of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
>
> If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= text1.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= text2.length <= 1000`
* The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.

## Solutions

```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        l_str = s_str = ''
        if len(text1) < len(text2):
            l_str = text2
            s_str = text1
        else:
            l_str = text1
            s_str = text2
            
        dp = [[0] * (len(s_str) + 1) for _ in range(2)]
        
        for i, c in enumerate(l_str):
            for j, d in enumerate(s_str):
                dp[1 - i % 2][j + 1] = 1 + dp[i % 2][j] if c == d else max(dp[i % 2][j + 1], dp[1 - i % 2][j])
                
        return dp[len(l_str) % 2][-1]
```
