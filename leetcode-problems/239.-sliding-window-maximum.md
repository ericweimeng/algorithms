# 239. Sliding Window Maximum

> Given an array _nums_, there is a sliding window of size _k_ which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the _k_ numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the max sliding window.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3
> Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7] 
> Explanation: 
>
> Window position                Max
> ---------------               -----
> [1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
>  1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
>  1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
>  1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
>  1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
>  1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
> ```
>
> **Note:**  
> You may assume _k_ is always valid, 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ input array's size for non-empty array.

> **Follow up:**  
> Could you solve it in linear time?

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Deque, sliding window

```python
from collections import deque
class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        d = deque()
        res = []
        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            while d and nums[d[-1]] < n:
                d.pop()
            d.append(i)
            if d[0] == i - k:
                d.popleft()
            if i >= k - 1: # contains a window with size k, then append
                res.append(nums[d[0]])
        
        return res
```
