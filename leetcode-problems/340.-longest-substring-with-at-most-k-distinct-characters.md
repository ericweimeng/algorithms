# 340. Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters

> Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
> Output: 3
> Explanation: T is "ece" which its length is 3.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: s = "aa", k = 1
> Output: 2
> Explanation: T is "aa" which its length is 2.
> ```

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Optimal solution

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        start, res = 0, 0
        window = {}
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            window[c] = i
            if len(window) > k:
                start = min(window.values()) + 1
                del window[s[start - 1]] # 后续要根据window长度判断是否超过k所以记住删除左窗口字符
            res = max(res, i - start + 1)
        return res
```
