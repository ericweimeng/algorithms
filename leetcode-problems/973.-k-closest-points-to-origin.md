# 973. K Closest Points to Origin

> We have a list of `points` on the plane.  Find the `K` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.
>
> \(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.\)
>
> You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique \(except for the order that it is in.\)
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1
> Output: [[-2,2]]
> Explanation: 
> The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
> The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
> Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
> We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2
> Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
> (The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. `1 <= K <= points.length <= 10000`
> 2. `-10000 < points[i][0] < 10000`
> 3. `-10000 < points[i][1] < 10000`

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 heapq

```python
import heapq
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], K: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        d = [(x**2 + y**2, x, y) for x, y in points]
        heapq.heapify(d)
        res = heapq.nsmallest(K, d)
        return [[item[1], item[2]] for item in res]
```
