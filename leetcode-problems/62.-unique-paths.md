# 62. Unique Paths

> A robot is located at the top-left corner of a _m_ x _n_ grid \(marked 'Start' in the diagram below\).
>
> The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid \(marked 'Finish' in the diagram below\).
>
> How many possible unique paths are there?
>
> ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/robot_maze.png)  
> Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?
>
> **Note:** _m_ and _n_ will be at most 100.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: m = 3, n = 2
> Output: 3
> Explanation:
> From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
> 1. Right -> Right -> Down
> 2. Right -> Down -> Right
> 3. Down -> Right -> Right
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: m = 7, n = 3
> Output: 28
> ```

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Two dimensional array DP

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[1 if i == 0 or j == 0 else 0 for j in range(n)] for i in range(m)]
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j]
                
        return dp[-1][-1]
```

### Approach \#2 One dimensional array DP, Optimal solution

Time: O\(m\*n\)

Space: O\(n\)

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [1 for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                dp[j] = dp[j] + dp[j - 1]
        return dp[-1]
```
