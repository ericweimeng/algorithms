# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

> Given a binary search tree \(BST\), find the lowest common ancestor \(LCA\) of two given nodes in the BST.
>
> According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants \(where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**\).”
>
> Given binary search tree:  root = \[6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5\]![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
> Output: 6
> Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
> Output: 2
> Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> * All of the nodes' values will be unique.
> * p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 DFS, Recursion

Time: O\(n\)

Space: O\(h\)

```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        if not root or root.val == p.val or root == q.val:
            return root
        if root.val < min(p.val, q.val):
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        elif root.val > max(p.val, q.val):
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        return root
```

### Approach \#2 Iterative

```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        if not root:
            return
        cur = root
        while cur:
            if min(p.val, q.val) <= cur.val <= max(p.val, q.val):
                return cur
            if cur.val < min(p.val, q.val):
                cur = cur.right
            else:
                cur = cur.left
```
