# 824. Goat Latin

> A sentence `S` is given, composed of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.
>
> We would like to convert the sentence to "_Goat Latin"_ \(a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.\)
>
> The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:
>
> * If a word begins with a vowel \(a, e, i, o, or u\), append `"ma"` to the end of the word. For example, the word 'apple' becomes 'applema'.  
> * If a word begins with a consonant \(i.e. not a vowel\), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add `"ma"`. For example, the word `"goat"` becomes `"oatgma"`.  
> * Add one letter `'a'` to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1. For example, the first word gets `"a"` added to the end, the second word gets `"aa"` added to the end and so on.
>
> Return the final sentence representing the conversion from `S` to Goat Latin. 
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: "I speak Goat Latin"
> Output: "Imaa peaksmaaa oatGmaaaa atinLmaaaaa"
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
> Output: "heTmaa uickqmaaa rownbmaaaa oxfmaaaaa umpedjmaaaaaa overmaaaaaaa hetmaaaaaaaa azylmaaaaaaaaa ogdmaaaaaaaaaa"
> ```
>
> Notes:
>
> * `S` contains only uppercase, lowercase and spaces. Exactly one space between each word.
> * `1 <= S.length <= 150`.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1

```python
class Solution:
    def toGoatLatin(self, S: str) -> str:
        vowel= set('aeiouAEIOU')
        def goat_latin(w, i):
            if w[0] not in vowel:
                w = w[1:] + w[0]
            return w + 'ma' + 'a' * (i + 1)
        return ' '.join(goat_latin(w, i) for i, w in enumerate(S.split()))
```

### Approach \#2, One of the optimal solution

```python
class Solution:
    def toGoatLatin(self, S: str) -> str:
        words = []
        for i, word in enumerate(S.split()):
            if word[0].lower() in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']:
                words.append(word + 'ma' + 'a'*(i+1))
            else:
                words.append(word[1:] + word[0] + 'ma' + 'a'*(i+1))
        return ' '.join(words)
```
