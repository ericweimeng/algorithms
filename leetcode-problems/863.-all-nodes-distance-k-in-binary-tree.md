# 863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree

> We are given a binary tree \(with root node `root`\), a `target` node, and an integer value `K`.

> Return a list of the values of all nodes that have a distance `K` from the `target` node.  The answer can be returned in any order.

> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, K = 2
>
> Output: [7,4,1]
>
> Explanation: 
> The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5)
> have values 7, 4, and 1.
>
> Note that the inputs "root" and "target" are actually TreeNodes.
> The descriptions of the inputs above are just serializations of these objects.

**Note:**

1. The given tree is non-empty.
2. Each node in the tree has unique values `0 <= node.val <= 500`.
3. The `target` node is a node in the tree.
4. `0 <= K <= 1000`.

## **Approach 1: Annotate Parent**

**Intuition**

If we know the parent of every node `x`, we know all nodes that are distance `1` from `x`. We can then perform a breadth first search from the `target` node to find the answer.

**Algorithm**

We first do a depth first search where we annotate every node with information about it's parent.

After, we do a breadth first search to find all nodes a distance `K` from the `target`.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def distanceK(self, root, target, K):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type target: TreeNode
        :type K: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        # blocker 1 for this problem of how to easily trace back to the parent of the target
        def dfs(node, parent = None):
            if node:
                node.parent = parent
                dfs(node.left, node)
                dfs(node.right, node)
        
        dfs(root)
        
        queue = collections.deque([(target, 0)])
        seen = {target} # it is also tracing back to its parent, then if does not have this set, it will traverse it child again
        while queue:
            if queue[0][1] == K:
                return [node.val for node, d in queue]
            node, d = queue.popleft()
            for nei in (node.left, node.right, node.parent):
                if nei and nei not in seen:
                    seen.add(nei)
                    queue.append((nei, d + 1))
        
        return []
                
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: O\(N\), where N is the number of nodes in the given tree.
* Space Complexity: O\(N\). 

## **Approach 2: Percolate Distance**

**Intuition**

From `root`, say the `target` node is at depth `3` in the left branch. It means that any nodes that are distance `K - 3` in the right branch should be added to the answer.

**Algorithm**

Traverse every `node` with a depth first search `dfs`. We'll add all nodes `x` to the answer such that `node` is the node on the path from `x` to `target` that is closest to the `root`.

To help us, `dfs(node)` will return the distance from `node` to the `target`. Then, there are 4 cases:

* If `node == target`, then we should add nodes that are distance `K` in the subtree rooted at `target`.
* If `target` is in the left branch of `node`, say at distance `L+1`, then we should look for nodes that are distance `K - L - 1` in the right branch.
* If `target` is in the right branch of `node`, the algorithm proceeds similarly.
* If `target` isn't in either branch of `node`, then we stop.

In the above algorithm, we make use of the auxiliary function `subtree_add(node, dist)`which adds the nodes in the subtree rooted at `node` that are distance `K - dist` from the given `node`.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def distanceK(self, root, target, K):
        ans = []

        # Return distance from node to target if exists, else -1
        # Vertex distance: the # of vertices on the path from node to target
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return -1
            elif node is target:
                subtree_add(node, 0)
                return 1
            else:
                L, R = dfs(node.left), dfs(node.right)
                if L != -1:
                    if L == K: ans.append(node.val)
                    subtree_add(node.right, L + 1)
                    return L + 1
                elif R != -1:
                    if R == K: ans.append(node.val)
                    subtree_add(node.left, R + 1)
                    return R + 1
                else:
                    return -1

        # Add all nodes 'K - dist' from the node to answer.
        def subtree_add(node, dist):
            if not node:
                return
            elif dist == K:
                ans.append(node.val)
            else:
                subtree_add(node.left, dist + 1)
                subtree_add(node.right, dist + 1)

        dfs(root)
        return ans
```
