# 1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix

> In an N by N square grid, each cell is either empty \(0\) or blocked \(1\).
>
> A _clear path from top-left to bottom-right_ has length `k` if and only if it is composed of cells `C_1, C_2, ..., C_k` such that:
>
> * Adjacent cells `C_i` and `C_{i+1}` are connected 8-directionally \(ie., they are different and share an edge or corner\)
> * `C_1` is at location `(0, 0)` \(ie. has value `grid[0][0]`\)
> * `C_k` is at location `(N-1, N-1)` \(ie. has value `grid[N-1][N-1]`\)
> * If `C_i` is located at `(r, c)`, then `grid[r][c]` is empty \(ie. `grid[r][c] == 0`\).
>
> Return the length of the shortest such clear path from top-left to bottom-right.  If such a path does not exist, return -1.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [[0,1],[1,0]]


Output: 2

```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [[0,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]


Output: 4

```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 100`
2. `grid[r][c]` is `0` or `1`

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 BFS Optimal solutions

Traverse level by level and when it first reaches the destination, it's the shortest path

Time: O\(\)

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestPathBinaryMatrix(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(grid)
        if grid[0][0] or grid[n-1][n-1]:
            return -1
        q = [(0, 0, 1)]
        for i, j, d in q:
            if i == n - 1 and j == n - 1:
                return d
            for x, y in ((i - 1, j - 1), (i - 1, j), (i - 1, j + 1), (i, j - 1), (i, j + 1), (i + 1, j + 1), (i + 1, j), (i + 1, j - 1)):
                if 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n and not grid[x][y]:
                    grid[x][y] = 1
                    q.append((x, y, d + 1))
                    
        return -1
```
