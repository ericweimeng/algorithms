# 256. Paint House

> There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
>
> The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a `n x 3` cost matrix. For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
>
> **Note:**  
> All costs are positive integers.

**Example:**

```text
Input: [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]Output: 10Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.              Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
```

## Approach \#1 DP

```python
class Solution:    def minCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:        if not costs:            return 0                n = len(costs)                dp = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(n + 1)]                dp[0][0] = dp[0][1] = dp[0][2] = 0                for i in range(1, n + 1):            for j in range(3):                dp[i][j] = float('inf')                for k in range(3):                    if j != k:                        # dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][k] + costs[i - 1][k])                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][k] + costs[i - 1][j])                                return min(dp[n][0], dp[n][1], dp[n][2])
