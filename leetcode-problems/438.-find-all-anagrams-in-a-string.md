# 438. Find All Anagrams in a String

> Given a string **s** and a **non-empty** string **p**, find all the start indices of **p**'s anagrams in **s**.
>
> Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings **s** and **p** will not be larger than 20,100.
>
> The order of output does not matter.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input:
s: "abab" p: "ab"

Output:
[0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Sliding Window

```python
class Solution:
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        l = len(p)
        cp = collections.Counter(p)
        cs = collections.Counter(s[:l-1])
        i = 0
        while i + l <= len(s):
            cs[s[i + l - 1]] += 1 # add one more char to form a window
            if cs == cp:
                res.append(i)
            cs[s[i]] -= 1
            if cs[s[i]] == 0:
                del cs[s[i]]
                
            i += 1
            
        return res
```
