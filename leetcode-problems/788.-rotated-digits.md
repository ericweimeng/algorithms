# 788. Rotated Digits

> X is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from X.  Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone.
>
> A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves; 2 and 5 rotate to each other \(on this case they are rotated in a different direction, in other words 2 or 5 gets mirrored\); 6 and 9 rotate to each other, and the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.
>
> Now given a positive number `N`, how many numbers X from `1` to `N` are good?
>
> ```text
> Example:
> Input: 10
> Output: 4
> Explanation: 
> There are four good numbers in the range [1, 10] : 2, 5, 6, 9.
> Note that 1 and 10 are not good numbers, since they remain unchanged after rotating.
> ```

> **Note:**

> * N  will be in range `[1, 10000]`.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1

```python
class Solution:
    def rotatedDigits(self, N: int) -> int:
        counts = 0
        for num in range(1, N + 1):
            number = str(num)
            if '3' in number or '7' in number or '4' in number:
                continue
            if '2' in number or '5' in number or '6' in number or '9' in number:
                counts += 1
        return counts
```
