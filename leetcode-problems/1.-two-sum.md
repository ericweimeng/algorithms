# 1. Two Sum

> Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
>
> You may assume that each input would have _**exactly**_ one solution, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
>
> Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
> return [0, 1].
> ```

## Solutions

### Approach \#1, Hash table, Optimal Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        m = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if num in m:  # not target - num, and check key existence first like this
                return [m[num], i] # again not target - num
            m[target - num] = i
```
