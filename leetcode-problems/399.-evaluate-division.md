# 399. Evaluate Division

> Equations are given in the format `A / B = k`, where `A` and `B` are variables represented as strings, and `k` is a real number \(floating point number\). Given some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, return `-1.0`.
>
> **Example:**  
> Given `a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0.`  
> queries are: `a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? .`  
> return `[6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ].`
>
> The input is: `vector<pair<string, string>> equations, vector<double>& values, vector<pair<string, string>> queries` , where `equations.size() == values.size()`, and the values are positive. This represents the equations. Return `vector<double>`.
>
> According to the example above:
>
> ```text
> equations = [ ["a", "b"], ["b", "c"] ],
> values = [2.0, 3.0],
> queries = [ ["a", "c"], ["b", "a"], ["a", "e"], ["a", "a"], ["x", "x"] ]. 
> ```
>
> The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will result in no division by zero and there is no contradiction.

### Approach \#1 Undirected Graph

Time: O\(\)

```python
class Solution:
    def calcEquation(self, equations: List[List[str]], values: List[float], queries: List[List[str]]) -> List[float]:
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for (dd, dv), q in zip(equations, values):
            graph[dd].append((dv, q))
            graph[dv].append((dd, 1.0 / q))
        def find_path(query):
            b, e = query
            
            if b not in graph or e not in graph:
                return -1.0
                
            q = collections.deque([(b, 1.0)])
            visited = set()
            
            while q:
                front, cur_product = q.popleft()
                if front == e:
                    return cur_product
                visited.add(front)
                for neighbor, value in graph[front]:
                    if neighbor not in visited:
                        q.append((neighbor, cur_product*value))
            
            return -1.0
        return [find_path(q) for q in queries]
