# 785. Is Graph Bipartite?

> Given an undirected `graph`, return `true` if and only if it is bipartite.
>
> Recall that a graph is _bipartite_ if we can split it's set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B.
>
> The graph is given in the following form: `graph[i]` is a list of indexes `j` for which the edge between nodes `i` and `j` exists.  Each node is an integer between `0` and `graph.length - 1`.  There are no self edges or parallel edges: `graph[i]` does not contain `i`, and it doesn't contain any element twice.

> |    |
> 3----2
> We can divide the vertices into two groups: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.

> Output: false
> Explanation: 
> The graph looks like this:
> 0----1

> 3----2
> We cannot find a way to divide the set of nodes into two independent subsets.

> **Note:**
>
> * `graph` will have length in range `[1, 100]`.
> * `graph[i]` will contain integers in range `[0, graph.length - 1]`.
> * `graph[i]` will not contain `i` or duplicate values.
> * The graph is undirected: if any element `j` is in `graph[i]`, then `i` will be in `graph[j]`.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 DFS

Time O\(V + E\)

Space O\(V\)

```python
class Solution:
    def isBipartite(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        colored = {}
        for i in range(len(graph)):
            if i not in colored and not self.dfs(graph, i, 1, colored):
                return False
        return True
        
    def dfs(self, graph, v, color, colored):
        if v in colored:
            return colored[v] == color
        colored[v] = color
        for nei in graph[v]:
            if not self.dfs(graph, nei, color * -1, colored):
                return False
        return True
```

### Approach \#2 BFS

```python
class Solution:
    def isBipartite(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        n = len(graph)
        colors = {node: 0 for node in range(n)}
        q = collections.deque([])
        for i in range(n):
            if colors[i] != 0:
                continue
            colors[i] = 1
            q.append(i)
            while q:
                node = q.popleft()
                for nei in graph[node]:
                    if colors[nei] != 0 and colors[nei] == colors[node]:
                        return False
                    if colors[nei] == 0:
                        colors[nei] = colors[node] * -1
                        q.append(nei)
        return True
```
