# 1170. Compare Strings by Frequency of the Smallest Character

> Let's define a function `f(s)` over a non-empty string `s`, which calculates the frequency of the smallest character in `s`. For example, if `s = "dcce"` then `f(s) = 2` because the smallest character is `"c"` and its frequency is 2.
>
> Now, given string arrays `queries` and `words`, return an integer array `answer`, where each `answer[i]` is the number of words such that `f(queries[i])` &lt; `f(W)`, where `W` is a word in `words`.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: queries = ["cbd"], words = ["zaaaz"]
> Output: [1]
> Explanation: On the first query we have f("cbd") = 1, f("zaaaz") = 3 so f("cbd") < f("zaaaz").
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: queries = ["bbb","cc"], words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
> Output: [1,2]
> Explanation: On the first query only f("bbb") < f("aaaa"). On the second query both f("aaa") and f("aaaa") are both > f("cc").
> ```
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> * `1 <= queries.length <= 2000`
> * `1 <= words.length <= 2000`
> * `1 <= queries[i].length, words[i].length <= 10`
> * `queries[i][j]`, `words[i][j]` are English lowercase letters.

## Solutions

* min\(w\) will give smallest character for each word 'w' in 'words' list
* w.count\(min\(w\)\) will give frequency of smallest character for each word 'w' in 'words' list
* 'f' is the sorted frequency list of 'words'
* For each query 'q' in 'queries' list, we find its rightmost suitable index in the frequency 'f' list
* Total length of frequency list 'f' minus index will give answer\[i\]
* Index is determined by bisect module, which gives number of words having frequency of their smallest character less than or equal to query 'q'

### Approach \#1, Binary search + string + array, optimal solution

```python
class Solution:
    def numSmallerByFrequency(self, queries: List[str], words: List[str]) -> List[int]:
        W = sorted(word.count(min(word)) for word in words)
        res = []
        for q in queries:
            query = q.count(min(q))
            index = bisect.bisect(W, query)
            res.append(len(words) - index)
        return res
```
