# 1188. Design Bounded Blocking Queue

> Implement a thread safe bounded blocking queue that has the following methods:
>
> * `BoundedBlockingQueue(int capacity)` The constructor initializes the queue with a maximum `capacity`.
> * `void enqueue(int element)` Adds an `element` to the front of the queue. If the queue is full, the calling thread is blocked until the queue is no longer full.
> * `int dequeue()` Returns the element at the rear of the queue and removes it. If the queue is empty, the calling thread is blocked until the queue is no longer empty.
> * `int size()` Returns the number of elements currently in the queue.
>
> Your implementation will be tested using multiple threads at the same time. Each thread will either be a producer thread that only makes calls to the `enqueue` method or a consumer thread that only makes calls to the `dequeue` method. The `size` method will be called after every test case.
>
> Please do not use built-in implementations of bounded blocking queue as this will not be accepted in an interview.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Semaphore

The idea is to use two semaphores, pushing and pulling, to maintain the invariants of the queue. Initially, no thread can dequeue \(self.pulling.acquire\(\)\) until a thread has enqueued \(self.pulling.release\(\)\). When capacity elements have been enqueued, self.pushing.acquire\(\) will block the thread until a dequeue releases the semaphore again. Notice that the deque is thread safe, therefore we don't have to use lock to lock queue.

```python
import threading

class BoundedBlockingQueue(object):

    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.pushing = threading.Semaphore(capacity)
        self.pulling = threading.Semaphore(0)
        self.queue = collections.deque()

    def enqueue(self, element: int) -> None:
        self.pushing.acquire()
        
        self.queue.append(element)
        
        self.pulling.release()

    def dequeue(self) -> int:
        self.pulling.acquire()
        
        res = self.queue.popleft()
        
        self.pushing.release()
        return res

    def size(self) -> int:
        return len(self.queue)
```

### Approach \#2 Only Locks

```python
import threading

class BoundedBlockingQueue(object):

    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.en = threading.Lock()
        self.de = threading.Lock()
        self.q = collections.deque()
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.de.acquire()

    def enqueue(self, element: int) -> None:
        self.en.acquire()
        self.q.append(element)
        if len(self.q) < self.capacity:
            self.en.release()
        if self.de.locked():
            self.de.release()

    def dequeue(self) -> int:
        self.de.acquire()
        val = self.q.popleft()
        if len(self.q):
            self.de.release()
        if val and self.en.locked():
            self.en.release()
        return val

    def size(self) -> int:
        return len(self.q)
```
