# 1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses

> Given a string s of `'('` , `')'` and lowercase English characters. 
>
> Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses \( `'('` or `')'`, in any positions \) so that the resulting _parentheses string_ is valid and return **any** valid string.
>
> Formally, a _parentheses string_ is valid if and only if:
>
> * It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
> * It can be written as `AB` \(`A` concatenated with `B`\), where `A` and `B` are valid strings, or
> * It can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a valid string.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: s = "lee(t(c)o)de)"
> Output: "lee(t(c)o)de"
> Explanation: "lee(t(co)de)" , "lee(t(c)ode)" would also be accepted.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: s = "a)b(c)d"
> Output: "ab(c)d"
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input: s = "))(("
> Output: ""
> Explanation: An empty string is also valid.
> ```
>
> **Example 4:**
>
> ```text
> Input: s = "(a(b(c)d)"
> Output: "a(b(c)d)"
> ```
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> * `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
> * `s[i]` is one of  `'('` , `')'` and lowercase English letters`.`

## Solutions

### Approach \#1

```python
class Solution:
    def minRemoveToMakeValid(self, s: str) -> str:
        remove_pos = set()
        lefts = []
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c == '(':
                lefts.append(i)
            elif c == ')':
                if lefts:
                    lefts.pop()
                else:
                    remove_pos.add(i)
        remove_pos |= set(lefts)
        return ''.join(c for i, c in enumerate(s) if i not in remove_pos)
```

### Approach \#2 one of optimal solutions

Since we will have case like '\)\)\(\(', therefore, the only way that we can safely add possible '\(\)' to result when we encounter '\)' is to make sure for each '\(', there is a '\)' as an enclosing bracket. Any char other than '\(' and '\)' will be added to result immediately. For each '\(' we don't know if we should keep it or remove it, then we just simply add everything valid to a stack up to this point \(before the current '\('\).  Once it encounters a '\)', it pops up everything between current \) to the last \(, so that they can group a \(....\).

#### Takeaway

* Stack
  * be sensitive to its nature: FILO
* Not only single number/char, 有时候也要考虑能否成段压栈，充分利用特点性质

```python
class Solution:
    def minRemoveToMakeValid(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack, cur = [], ''
        for c in s:
            if c == '(':
                stack.append(cur)
                cur = ''
            elif c == ')':
                if stack:
                    cur = stack.pop() + '(' + cur + ')'
            else:
                cur += c
        while stack:
            cur = stack.pop() + cur
        return cur
```
