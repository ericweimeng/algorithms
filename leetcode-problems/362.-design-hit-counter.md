# 362. Design Hit Counter

> Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past 5 minutes.
>
> Each function accepts a timestamp parameter \(in seconds granularity\) and you may assume that calls are being made to the system in chronological order \(ie, the timestamp is monotonically increasing\). You may assume that the earliest timestamp starts at 1.
>
> It is possible that several hits arrive roughly at the same time.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> HitCounter counter = new HitCounter();
>
> // hit at timestamp 1.
> counter.hit(1);
>
> // hit at timestamp 2.
> counter.hit(2);
>
> // hit at timestamp 3.
> counter.hit(3);
>
> // get hits at timestamp 4, should return 3.
> counter.getHits(4);
>
> // hit at timestamp 300.
> counter.hit(300);
>
> // get hits at timestamp 300, should return 4.
> counter.getHits(300);
>
> // get hits at timestamp 301, should return 3.
> counter.getHits(301); 
> ```
>
> **Follow up:**  
> What if the number of hits per second could be very large? Does your design scale?

## Solutions

### Approach \#1

```python
class HitCounter:

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        # having a total number of hit would help to calculate total hits in a time range
        self.num_of_hits = 0
        # having a queue to natrually support chronological order
        self.time_hits = collections.deque()
        

    def hit(self, timestamp: int) -> None:
        """
        Record a hit.
        @param timestamp - The current timestamp (in seconds granularity).
        """
        # when a hit comes in with a timestamp, we need to make sure if it belongs to an existing timestamp
        # since we may have cases where many hits come in at a same time
        if not self.time_hits or self.time_hits[-1][0] != timestamp:
            self.time_hits.append([timestamp, 1])
        else:
            self.time_hits[-1][1] += 1
        self.num_of_hits += 1
        

    def getHits(self, timestamp: int) -> int:
        """
        Return the number of hits in the past 5 minutes.
        @param timestamp - The current timestamp (in seconds granularity).
        """
        # need to substract those hits from earlier time which does not belong to the current time interval
        while self.time_hits and self.time_hits[0][0] <= timestamp - 300:
            self.num_of_hits -= self.time_hits.popleft()[1]
        
        return self.num_of_hits
```
