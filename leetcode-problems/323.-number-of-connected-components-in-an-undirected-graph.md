# 323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph

> Given `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and a list of undirected edges \(each edge is a pair of nodes\), write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]
>
>      0          3
>      |          |
>      1 --- 2    4 
>
> Output: 2
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]
>
>      0           4
>      |           |
>      1 --- 2 --- 3
>
> Output:  1
> ```
>
> **Note:**  
> You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in `edges`. Since all edges are undirected, `[0, 1]` is the same as `[1, 0]` and thus will not appear together in `edges`.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 DFS

```python
class Solution:
    
    def countComponents(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        num_comps = 0
        visited = set()
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in visited:
                visited.add(i)
                num_comps += 1
                for nei in graph[i]:
                    self.dfs(graph, nei, visited)
                    
        return num_comps        
    
    def dfs(self, graph, node, visited):
        if node in visited:
            return
        visited.add(node)
        for nei in graph[node]:
            self.dfs(graph, nei, visited)
```

### Approach \#2 BFS

```python
class Solution:
    
    def countComponents(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        num_comps = 0
        visited = set()
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)
        
        q = collections.deque([])
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in visited:
                visited.add(i)
                q.append(i)
                num_comps += 1
                while q:
                    node = q.popleft()
                    for nei in graph[node]:
                        if nei not in visited:
                            visited.add(nei)
                            q.append(nei)
        return num_comps
```
