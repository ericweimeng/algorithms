# 243. Shortest Word Distance

> Given a list of words and two words _word1_ and _word2_, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.
>
> **Example:**  
> Assume that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.
>
> ```text
> Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
> Output: 3
> ```
>
> ```text
> Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
> Output: 1
> ```
>
> **Note:**  
> You may assume that _word1_ **does not equal to** _word2_, and _word1_ and _word2_ are both in the list.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1

The general idea of this solution is to iterate the array, when we find a matched word, we check if previously saw the other word, if yes, then update res. And after the update, we want to set one\_word flag to be current word since any same word comes after the current word has longer distance.

Time: O\(n\)

Space: O\(1\)

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestDistance(self, words: List[str], word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        one_word = None
        one_word_idx = 0
        res = len(words)
        for i, word in enumerate(words):
            if word != word1 and word != word2:
                continue
            elif one_word and one_word != word:
                res = min(res, i - one_word_idx)
            one_word = word
            one_word_idx = i
        return res
```
