# 554. Brick Wall

> There is a brick wall in front of you. The wall is rectangular and has several rows of bricks. The bricks have the same height but different width. You want to draw a vertical line from the **top** to the **bottom** and cross the **least** bricks.
>
> The brick wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a list of integers representing the width of each brick in this row from left to right.
>
> If your line go through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You need to find out how to draw the line to cross the least bricks and return the number of crossed bricks.
>
> **You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks.**
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [[1,2,2,1],
>         [3,1,2],
>         [1,3,2],
>         [2,4],
>         [3,1,2],
>         [1,3,1,1]]
>
> Output: 2

> **Note:**

> 1. The width sum of bricks in different rows are the same and won't exceed INT\_MAX.
> 2. The number of bricks in each row is in range \[1,10,000\]. The height of wall is in range \[1,10,000\]. Total number of bricks of the wall won't exceed 20,000.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Hashmap

Time O\(n\*l\)

Space: O\(n\)

```python
class Solution:
    def leastBricks(self, wall: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        left_counter = collections.defaultdict(int)
        count = 0
        for row in wall:
            cur_to_left = 0
            for i in range(len(row) - 1):
                cur_to_left += row[i]
                left_counter[cur_to_left] += 1
                # 找一个从最左到当前距离的一致的砖最多的一行，这样在跨同样距离的右边界可以跨过最少的砖数
                count = max(count, left_counter[cur_to_left])
        return len(wall) - count
```
