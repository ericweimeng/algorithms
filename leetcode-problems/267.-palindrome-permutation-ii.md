# 267. Palindrome Permutation II

> Given a string `s`, return all the palindromic permutations \(without duplicates\) of it. Return an empty list if no palindromic permutation could be form.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: "aabb"
> Output: ["abba", "baab"]
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: "abc"
> Output: []
> ```

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Backtracking

```python
class Solution:
    def generatePalindromes(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        
        # Get dictionary map char to its appearance
        counts = collections.Counter(s)
        mid = ''
        base = ''
        res = []
        
        # Get mid char and base string
        for c in counts:
            if counts[c] % 2 != 0:
                if mid:
                    return []
                else:
                    mid = c
            base += c * (counts[c] // 2)
            
        self.dfs(base, 0, mid, res)
        return res
            
            
    def dfs(self, base, start, mid, res):
        
        # No more char can be used to permute, which means reached to the leaf in the tree
        if start == len(base):
            res.append(base + mid + base[::-1])
            return
        
        # Loop to permute char @ start with itself and all following different char
        for i in range(start, len(base)):
            
            # Prune the branch as duplicated!!!
            if i > start and (base[i] == base[i - 1] or base[i] == base[start]):
                continue
                
            # Get the permutation
            perm = base if i == start else base[:start] + base[i] + base[start + 1:i] + base[start] + base[i + 1:]
            
            # Permute next char with following chars
            self.dfs(perm, start + 1, mid, res)
```
