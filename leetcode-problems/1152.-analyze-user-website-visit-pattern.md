# 1152. Analyze User Website Visit Pattern

> We are given some website visits: the user with name `username[i]` visited the website `website[i]` at time `timestamp[i]`.
>
> A _3-sequence_ is a list of websites of length 3 sorted in ascending order by the time of their visits.  \(The websites in a 3-sequence are not necessarily distinct.\)
>
> Find the 3-sequence visited by the largest number of users. If there is more than one solution, return the lexicographically smallest such 3-sequence.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: username = ["joe","joe","joe","james","james","james","james","mary","mary","mary"], timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], website = ["home","about","career","home","cart","maps","home","home","about","career"]
> Output: ["home","about","career"]
> Explanation: 
> The tuples in this example are:
> ["joe", 1, "home"]
> ["joe", 2, "about"]
> ["joe", 3, "career"]
> ["james", 4, "home"]
> ["james", 5, "cart"]
> ["james", 6, "maps"]
> ["james", 7, "home"]
> ["mary", 8, "home"]
> ["mary", 9, "about"]
> ["mary", 10, "career"]
> The 3-sequence ("home", "about", "career") was visited at least once by 2 users.
> The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "maps") was visited at least once by 1 user.
> The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
> The 3-sequence ("home", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
> The 3-sequence ("cart", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. `3 <= N = username.length = timestamp.length = website.length <= 50`
> 2. `1 <= username[i].length <= 10`
> 3. `0 <= timestamp[i] <= 10^9`
> 4. `1 <= website[i].length <= 10`
> 5. Both `username[i]` and `website[i]` contain only lowercase characters.
> 6. It is guaranteed that there is at least one user who visited at least 3 websites.
> 7. No user visits two websites at the same time.

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Optimal Solution

```python
from itertools import combinations
class Solution:
    def mostVisitedPattern(self, username: List[str], timestamp: List[int], website: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        packed_visit = zip(timestamp, username, website)
        packed_visit_sorted = sorted(packed_visit)
        visited = collections.defaultdict(list)
        
        for t, u, w in packed_visit_sorted:
            visited[u].append(w)
        
        counts = collections.defaultdict(int)
        for web_list in visited.values():
            combs = set(combinations(web_list, 3))
            for comb in combs:
                counts[comb] += 1
                
        return sorted(counts, key=lambda x: (-counts[x], x))[0]
```
