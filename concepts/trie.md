# Trie

## What is a trie

> A trie is a tree-like data structure wherein the nodes of the tree store the entire alphabet, and strings/words can be retrieved by traversing down a branch path of the tree.

Trie \(we pronounce "try"\) or prefix tree is a tree data structure, which is used for retrieval of a key in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this very efficient data structure such as:

* Autocomplete
