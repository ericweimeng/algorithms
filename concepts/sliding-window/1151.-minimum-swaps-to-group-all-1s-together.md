# 1151. Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together

> Given a binary array `data`, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all `1`â€™s present in the array together in **any place** in the array.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [1,0,1,0,1]
> Output: 1
> Explanation: 
> There are 3 ways to group all 1's together:
> [1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
> [0,1,1,1,0] using 2 swaps.
> [0,0,1,1,1] using 1 swap.
> The minimum is 1.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [0,0,0,1,0]
> Output: 0
> Explanation: 
> Since there is only one 1 in the array, no swaps needed.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: 
> One possible solution that uses 3 swaps is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1].
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. `1 <= data.length <= 10^5`
> 2. `0 <= data[i] <= 1`

## Solutions

### Approach \#1 Sliding window, optimal solutions

* We should collect all 1's together with the length of number of 1's in the array.
* Sliding-window size is the length of all 1s and
* Find the window that has the least number of zeros to swap

```python
class Solution:
    def minSwaps(self, data: List[int]) -> int:
        frq_1 = data.count(1)
        res = cur = data[:frq_1].count(0)
        for i in range(frq_1, len(data)):
            cur += not data[i]
            cur -= not data[i - frq_1]
            res = min(res, cur)
        return res
```
